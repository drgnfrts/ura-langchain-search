date: 21 November 2022

---


Commercial developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

Commercial developments may make use of any combination of the bonus GFA incentive schemes (ie CSFS and Rooftop Greenery ORA), as long as the cumulative bonus GFA does not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.

Community and Sports Facilities Scheme

The Community and Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS) facilitates the co-location of compatible community and sports uses with highly accessible commercial developments. Under the CSFS, bonus GFA for the community and sports uses is subject to an overall cap of 10% of the maximum permissible GFA for the site allowed under the prevailing Master Plan or 2,000sqm (whichever is lower).

#### Eligible Commercial Developments

The co-location of community or sports uses under the CSFS is intended primarily for commercial retail developments which are highly accessible. The commercial development that may be considered for the community and/or sports uses under the CSFS shall be in close proximity to transport nodes or town centres/neighbourhood centres, and the additional CSFS space may be supported from the land use and transport planning points of view.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS would not be supported in hotel developments as the resultant synergies are limited.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS in office developments shall only be considered if it is clear that the use has clear synergies with the office development and caters to the needs of the office workers.

#### Allowable Community and Sports Uses

The proposed community and sports uses shall primarily be intended for public or community use and not profit-driven, with the exception of commercial child care centres endorsed by the Early Development Childhood Agency (ECDA). Refer to table below for a list of allowable uses.

Rooftop ORA on Landscaped Roofs

Refer to the section on [Greenery](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial/Greenery).

Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA1. Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

  

<table><tbody><tr><td><span style="color: black;">Residential<a href="file:///C:/Users/urawongyq/Documents/My%20documents/Updates/Flats%20and%20Condominiums%20-%20draft%20edit.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color: black;"><sup>2</sup></span></a></span><br></td><td><span>Condominium and Flats development </span> </td></tr><tr><td><span>Non- Residential</span></td><td><span>Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments </span><br></td></tr><tr><td><span>Mixed use</span></td><td><span>Combination of the above </span><br></td></tr></tbody></table>

  



1Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.

2The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme3. The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.



3Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA's grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA's grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes is summarised at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

#### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

Applicants are to comply with BE ITM outcomes for the bonus scheme based on the [building type](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-building-type.pdf). The specific requirements for the development proposal will be shared in detail as part of the application process to BCA for the Letter of Acceptance.

ORA within Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS)

Refer to section on [POPS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area/GFA/Privately-OwnedPublicSpacesPOPS).

The bonus GFA allowed under the bonus incentive schemes is over and above the MP GPR and is subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the bonus GFA incentive schemes cannot be carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.

**Other Incentive Schemes**

The CBD Incentive Scheme and the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) Scheme aim to encourage the rejuvenation of the CBD and other strategic areas in Singapore. Sites that fall within the designated areas for the CBD Incentive Scheme shall be guided by the CBD Incentive Scheme and shall not be considered under the SDI Scheme.

Details of the two schemes are as follows:

CBD Incentive Scheme

The CBD Incentive Scheme aims to encourage the conversion of existing, older, office developments into mixed-use developments that will help rejuvenate the CBD by:

-   Providing a wider diversity of uses, including more residences, hotels, and creative lifestyle possibilities;
-   Realising better connectivity to adjacent developments and transport nodes;
-   Creating a more intimate, people-friendly environment with walkable streets and public spaces that will provide an appealing address for people to live and work in.

The incentives are calibrated to encourage:

-   The creation of mixed-use neighbourhoods at the CBD fringe areas of Anson and Cecil Street, with greater extent of residential uses supported by a variety of social/community amenities;
-   A blend of mixed-uses within Robinson Road, Shenton Way and Tanjong Pagar, while retaining the predominantly commercial character of the core areas of our CBD in Raffles Place.

#### Eligibility

Existing predominantly office developments in selected areas where mixed-use neighbourhoods are encouraged will be eligible for the incentives if they meet the following eligibility requirements:

**CBD Incentive Scheme Eligibility Requirements**

1 Exemptions may be considered depending on the merits of the case.

#### Allowable Land Uses and Maximum Allowable Increase in Development Intensity

Residential and Hotel uses are encouraged within mixed-use developments to inject live-in population into the CBD. The allowable land uses and the corresponding maximum allowable increases in development intensity are shown in the table below. Approval of the allowable uses shall be subject to the statutory rezoning process and compliance with Rule 4 and Rule 7 of the Planning (Master Plan) Rules.

2 Based on GPR as stipulated on Master Plan 2019 or Approved GPR, whichever is higher.

3 Bonus GFA approved under the CBD Incentive Scheme shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The proposed increase in development intensity shall be subject to:

-   Planning approval from URA;
-   SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge, where applicable;
-   Compliance with the prevailing Urban Design guidelines for Downtown Core Planning Area;
-   Adoption of the lower bound of the Range-Based Parking Provision Standards as prescribed in LTA's prevailing Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision; and
-   A minimum score of Green Mark Platinum for the resultant development.

The maximum development intensity shown in the table above shall be assessed based on the detailed design, in relation to the site context and other planning or urban design considerations. URA may refuse planning approval, or grant planning approval with conditions if the proposal is not aligned with the planning intention of the area, or if the proposal is unable to comply with relevant technical and urban design requirements.

Bonus Gross Floor Area (GFA) shall not apply for the Green Mark requirements. Developments will still be eligible for Bonus GFA granted under other applicable schemes such as balcony or indoor recreational spaces, subject to the prevailing overall cap on Bonus GFA.

Lease renewals, where applicable, shall be subject to the approval of SLA and assessed in line with the Government's prevailing lease renewal policy.

#### Submission

Proposals under the CBD Incentive Scheme shall be submitted as an Outline Application to URA for consideration.

#### Implementation

The CBD Incentive Scheme will be implemented for a period of five years from the date of gazette for Master Plan 2019. URA will review the effectiveness and relevance of the scheme at the end of this period. URA reserves the right to vary or change the specific requirements outlined in the scheme during this five-year period.

Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) Scheme

Building owners of developments in strategic areas across Singapore may make use of the SDI Scheme in their applications for re-development if it meets the eligibility criteria.

The planning parameters for which deviations may be considered under the SDI Scheme are:

-   GPR/GFA;
-   Land Use and Use Quantum;
-   Building Height

#### Eligibility

The SDI Scheme is open to applications from building owners for developments in strategic areas across Singapore that meet the eligibility criteria.

In particular, applications to redevelop existing developments in Orchard Road, Central Business District (CBD) and Marina Centre areas are encouraged, in line with the broader planning intention to rejuvenate these areas. Sites that fall within the designated areas for the CBD Incentive Scheme shall be guided by that scheme instead of being considered under the SDI scheme.

Eligibility for consideration under the SDI Scheme is subject to the criteria outlined in the table below:

**SDI Scheme Eligibility Requirements**

<table><tbody><tr><td style="width: 25%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Age of Development</strong></td><td style="text-align: justify;">At least 20 years old from date of last TOP</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Existing Land Use</strong></td><td style="text-align: justify;">Commercial or mixed-use developments with predominantly commercial uses.<br><br>Developments with predominantly residential uses will not be eligible.</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Transformational Impact</strong></td><td style="text-align: justify;">The redevelopment proposal shall include a minimum of two adjacent sites, such that the amalgamated redevelopment can have a strong transformational impact on the surrounding environment that will enhance and rejuvenate the area.</td></tr></tbody></table>

New, innovative uses and concepts that offer a differentiated user experience are encouraged.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
Relevant technical agencies such as LTA and PUB shall be consulted to ensure that any proposed intensification can be supported from an infrastructure planning perspective. URA will guide the proposals to ensure that planning objectives are achieved.

Approval of the proposals shall be subject to the statutory rezoning process and compliance with Rule 4 and Rule 7 of the Planning (Master Plan) Rules.

#### Submission

Proposals under the SDI Scheme shall be submitted as an Outline Application to URA for consideration. Form [DC/SDI](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-03/dc19-03-App1-1.pdf) shall be completed and attached to the submission. The work flow for processing an application is shown in [here.](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-03/dc19-03-App1-2.pdf)

#### Conditions

The evaluation by URA under the SDI Scheme is proposal-specific. An application that has been previously approved by the URA shall not be used or taken as a precedent for any other proposals or development applications seeking similar deviations from the planning parameters.

Any additional incentive GFA or development intensity granted under the SDI Scheme may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

Any increase in development intensity approved by URA under this scheme shall not count towards the future development potential of the subject site.

Bonus GFA shall not apply for requirements mandated as part of the SDI Scheme. For example, if a minimum Green Mark score is required, the prevailing Green Mark Bonus GFA shall not apply. The developments will still be eligible for Bonus GFA granted under other applicable schemes such as balcony or indoor recreational spaces, subject to the prevailing overall cap on Bonus GFA.

Lease renewals, where applicable, shall be subject to the approval of SLA and assessed in line with the Government's prevailing lease renewal policy.

#### Implementation

The SDI Scheme, implemented from 27 March 2019, is for a period of five years from the date of gazette for Master Plan 2019. URA will review the effectiveness and relevance of the scheme at the end of this period.
