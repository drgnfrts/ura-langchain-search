All buildings in mixed commercial and residential developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All buildings in mixed commercial and residential developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The road buffer and common boundary setback requirements for mixed commercial and residential developments are determined by the building form, and are detailed in the table below.
