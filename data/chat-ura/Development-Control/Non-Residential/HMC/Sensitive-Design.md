The design of HMC developments shall take into consideration the surrounding uses. For example, the building orientation and internal floor layout shall be designed with due care and consideration to address the amenity and privacy concerns of neighbouring developments. Fa√ßade screenings, copious planting along the periphery boundary, generous building setback from common boundary, high windows etc are encouraged to blend in the HMC development with the surroundings.
