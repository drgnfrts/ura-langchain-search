A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

The physical limit which the basement may be built up to is shown in the table below.

1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.
