Community centres or community clubs are developed and managed by the People's Association (PA). They may be free-standing or independent developments or co-located with other public service facilities like public libraries, neighbourhood police centres.

Other private clubs are zoned Sports & Recreation in the Master Plan – see their guidelines under the tab [Sports & Recreation](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/SR).

Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The minimum GPR for community centres or community clubs is 1.4.

The allowable gross plot ratio and number of storeys for community centres or community clubs shall take into account the character of the surrounding area.

The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

Use Quantum

Ancillary commercial quantum up to 20% of the total building GFA may be provided in community centres or community clubs managed by the PA. The actual commercial quantum allowable is subject to planning consideration depending on the location, site condition, site context, impact on the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies.
