The White component within industrial developments may be strata-subdivided. The industrial and White uses within B1 developments may be contained in separate buildings provided that there is no land subdivision.

### Guidelines for Allowable Uses

Guidelines on Showroom

Showroom in industrial premises are meant primarily for the display of two categories of products as follows:

-   Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the counter (eg bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle).
-   Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (eg floor tiles).

Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and when the prospective end-user or business operator for the showroom space is known.

Showroom may be considered subject to the following:

-   Showroom shall be confined to the 1st storey of the development.
-   SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Ancillary Display Area

An ancillary display area is meant only for the display of products related to the predominant industrial operations in the development.

Ancillary display area may be considered subject to the following conditions:

-   Displayed products are purely for corporate or demonstration purposes that serve corporate customers of the industrial companies only and not open to public;
-   These products cannot be sold on-the-premises or on site;
-   There shall be no strata-subdivision or sub-leasing of these areas; and
-   Endorsement from relevant agencies (eg HDB & JTC for leased premises; EDB & ESG for private premises) may be required.

SLA may assess such ancillary display areas based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Conversion of Previously-Approved Ancillary Showroom

If an existing industrial development has a previously approved ancillary showroom (now re-termed Display Area), the owner or operator of such ancillary showroom may apply for planning permission to convert it to a showroom in accordance with the showroom definition and guideline stated above.

Alternatively, the previously approved ancillary showroom may be expanded to function as an enlarged ancillary display area in accordance with the current definition for ancillary display area and guideline stated above.

The table below shows what can or cannot be done to a previously approved ancillary showroom:

Guidelines on Industrial Canteen

Industrial canteens within industrial developments may include food stalls, cafeteria, food court primarily to serve workers in the industrial estate and may include members of the public.

These may be approved on Temporary Permission for up to 5 years subject to the following:

-   The size of the industrial canteen is capped at 700sqm or 5% of the total proposed GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
-   SLA may assess such industrial canteens based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Selected Commercial Uses

To provide basic amenities to workers in industrial estates located away from commercial centres, selected commercial uses namely; clinics, banking halls/ATMS, mini marts, fitness centre/gyms, may be considered on Temporary Permission for up to 3 years subject to the following:

-   The industrial development is located within one of the [outlying industrial estates](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Outlying_Industrial_Areas_Map.pdf) (PDF, 216 KB).
-   The commercial uses are located on the 1st storey of the development.
-   The total GFA of these commercial facilities shall not exceed 200sqm or 10% of the total GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
-   SLA may assess such commercial uses based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Childcare Centre (CCC) (allowed only in B1 zone)

CCCs within B1 industrial developments are meant to serve parents working in the industrial estate. Proposed CCCs may be considered only within B1 developments, subject to clearances from the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). CCCs are not permitted within B2 developments. See NEA's webpage [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/development-control/guidelines-for-building-plan-submission) and ECDA's webpage [here](https://www.ecda.gov.sg) for more information.

SLA may assess such CCCs based on Group E Civic and Community Institution rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Temporary Workers' Dormitory

Workers' dormitory are premises used to house migrant workers who are engaged to carry out industrial or production or construction activities. Dormitories may comprise new extensions to existing buildings or new building blocks within an industrial development or may be converted from existing spaces within an industrial development.

New workers' dormitories located outside specified areas (refer to Table 1 and 2 below) or renewal of existing dormitories may be considered on Temporary Permission (TP) for up to 5 years subject to compliance with prevailing guidelines and the use not causing disamenities.

To provide more temporary housing options for migrant workers while additional purpose-built dormitories are being constructed, URA and technical agencies will now assess applications for (i) new temporary workers' dormitories and (ii) increase in the number of workers in existing dormitories located within the specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1 below) on individual basis. If supported, the use will be on 3-years TP, and may not be renewed subsequently.



#### Types of Temporary Workers' Dormitories

-   Ancillary dormitories may house only workers employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development and workers who work on-site in the subject development.
-   Secondary dormitories may house workers not employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development as well as workers who work on- and off-site.

#### Location

-   All new proposed workers' dormitories or increase in capacity within industrial developments are assessed on the merits of the case.
-   New applications located within 13 specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1) will only be considered if the proposals meet prevailing guidelines, and can be supported by existing infrastructure as assessed by technical agencies. Please refer to the [circular](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2023/Feb/dc23-03) dated 10 Feb 2023 for more information.
-   Prior clearances from NEA, PUB, SCDF, and LTA shall be obtained before a proposal is submitted to URA for evaluation.
-   New workers' dormitories shall not fall within NEA and SCDF's health and safety buffer zones, sub-areas reviewed by PUB where there are existing sewer capacity constraints or specified areas listed in Table 2 below.
