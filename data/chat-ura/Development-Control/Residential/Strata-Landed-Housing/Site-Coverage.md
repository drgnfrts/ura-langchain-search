Communal Open Spaces

To safeguard the living environment of strata landed developments, minimum 45% of the nett site area1 of the strata landed housing development shall be set aside for Communal Open Space (COS).

1 The nett site area shall exclude land to be set aside for road widening & drainage reserve.

COS are communal recreational spaces provided for residents' enjoyment. Examples of COS are in the table below:

Of the 45% COS, at least 25% (as a percentage of site area) shall be set aside for communal on-ground greenery.

Areas classified as COS shall not be included in the boundary of the individual strata plots. For instance, the 2m planting strips and green buffers which form part of the minimum 45% COS provision, shall not contain any Private Enclosed Spaces (PES).
