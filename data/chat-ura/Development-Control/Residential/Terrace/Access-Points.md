The position of vehicular access point for terrace houses shall consider roadside planting and kerbside parking space provision. For example:

-   All vehicular access points for new landed housing developments shall preferably be paired to provide for a sufficiently wide space (at least 6m) between 2 access points.
-   Existing vehicular access points already in a paired arrangement today shall not be separated unless there is a separation space of at least 6m.
-   Sites with plot width of more than 10m need not pair up their access point with the adjacent unit, if the full continuous 6m planting verge can be provided within the plot width of the site.

Entrance to a Landed House

Only one main entrance door for a single residential unit for family dwelling purposes shall be allowed in a landed house.
