Site coverage ensures that there are adequate areas set aside for greenery and landscaping within the development.

The computation of site coverage has been simplified to include all building structures that protrude more than 1m from the ground as seen from the top-down â€˜Site Plan' view, and is expressed as a percentage of the net site area. The net site area refers to the area of the site excluding areas to be vested to the State for public roads, public road widening reserves1, and drainage reserves2.

The maximum site coverage for flats and condominiums is 50%.

In the Development Application, the Site Plan shall include a separate site coverage layer for computation purposes. An example is shown below.

1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

2 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.
