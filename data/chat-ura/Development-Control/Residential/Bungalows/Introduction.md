A bungalow is a detached landed house with its own land title1. It may be built in areas designated for landed housing developments or on land zoned for residential use if the development site area meets the minimum plot size, plot width and site coverage requirements for a bungalow development.

Bungalows may be built in any designated landed housing area, including semi-detached housing or mixed landed housing areas. In Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA) or in other bungalow areas, only bungalow developments are allowed.

At the individual plot level, a bungalow development shall adhere to the envelope control guidelines. These guidelines set out the allowable building envelope based on applicable storey height controls and building setback requirements. The allowable Gross Floor Area (GFA) for landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and envelope.

1 Bungalows may be strata-titled when approved as strata bungalows – refer to [Strata Landed Housing handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing) for guidelines and requirements.
