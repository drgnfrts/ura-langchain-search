The plot size and width refers to the net dimension and area of the plot excluding the land required to be set aside for vesting  to the State e.g. excluding Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR).

Bungalows (within GCBA) - Variations in plot dimensions

Variations in plot width, depth and size may be considered under the following circumstances.

-   The proposed development site is an in-fill development on an existing plot which is already deficient in plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm).  
-   For proposals arising from amalgamation and subdivision of GCBA lots, only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm) shall be allowed per amalgamation and subdivision proposal. The shortfall in the deficient plot size shall be due to vesting of land for public purpose (eg for road widening), and the shortfall in that plot size shall be less than 10%. All proposed new bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements for GCBs.
-   For proposals arising from a subdivision of GCBA lots containing conserved bungalows, the plot sizes of the new plot and the conserved bungalow plot shall be at least 2,800sqm (after setting aside for road widening/drainage reserve1, etc). Only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (less than 1,400sqm) of not less than 1,000sqm shall be allowed per conserved bungalow. This deficient plot shall be contiguous with the conserved bungalow plot. The proposed new bungalows and the conserved bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements.

1 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

Bungalows (outside GCBA) - Variations in plot width

For bungalow plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in plot width may be considered provided:

-   The average width of the plot remains at least 10m so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
-   The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m; and
-   The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines (eg setback, road buffer, etc).

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, is restricted to one new plot per development provided it is a new residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).
