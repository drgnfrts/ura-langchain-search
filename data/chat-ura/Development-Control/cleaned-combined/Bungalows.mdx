Proposals shall meet the following criteria to qualify as an Additions & Alterations (A&A) proposal:

-   Proposed additional gross floor area shall not exceed 50% of the approved gross floor area;
-   External walls that are to be removed and replaced with new walls shall not exceed 50% of the approved external walls;
-   Structural changes to the existing landed dwelling house (eg replacing or constructing new columns/beams and reconstructing existing floor slabs) shall not exceed 50% of existing building;
-   Changes/replacement of entire roof (with/without resultant increase in height) shall not involve an additional storey;
-   Addition of an attic, provided the increase in GFA shall be less than 50%.

Proposals that do not comply with the criteria for Additions & Alterations shall be considered as **Reconstruction** proposals. Works resulting in the following outcomes shall also be deemed as reconstruction, regardless of whether the works exceed 50% of the existing building GFA:

-   Increase in storey height (including changes/replacement of any part of the roof involving an additional storey);   
-   Change in landed dwelling housing form (for example, from a semi-detached house to a bungalow).

For existing landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal to ensure that the outcome is not worse off.

Retaining Existing Non-Conforming Structures in Additions and Alterations Proposals

URA may consider allowing landed houses undergoing Additions & Alterations (A&A) works or reconstruction to retain non-conforming structures1, subject to the following requirements:

-   At least 25% of the existing floor plate shall be retained, comprising an integrated wing of existing columns, beams, floor slab and external walls that includes the non-conforming portion of the house;
-   Submission of a Professional Engineer's (PE) certification to confirm that structures to be retained are structurally sound, can accommodate the new works proposed, and that appropriate construction methods will be used to ensure that they will not be damaged
-   If the existing front setback is deficient, there shall be a minimum absolute 2.4m setback distance provided from the front boundary line. The setback is measured from the boundary of the external wall/glass of the bay window.

URA shall be notified immediately if any of the non-conforming structures approved to be retained are demolished. The Qualified Person appointed by the owner shall make an amendment application for the new works to comply with prevailing DC guidelines, before any new works are carried out on site.

1 **Non-conforming Structures**: Structures within the existing house that were approved and built in the past, but do not comply with the prevailing development control guidelines.

-   All structures shall generally be confined within the envelope. The car porch and patio/terrace area are subject to the setback guidelines shown in the [Building Setbacks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Setbacks-from-boundaries) section.
-   Minor building appendages that do not increase the building bulk may be allowed to encroach slightly into the setback areas, as shown in the table below. While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
-   Allowable protrusion into the setbacks for other building appendages not covered in the matrix shall be assessed based on the merits of the proposal.

Car Porch

-   The height of the car porch shall not exceed 4.5m.
-   The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall remain open-to-sky and unenclosed area. Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:  
      
    1.  A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and railing);
    2.  A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch roof;
    3.  Planters for landscaping.

Minor Building Appendages

**Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks**

## Envelope Control Guidelines
---
title: Envelope Control Guidelines

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/EC

date: 27 June 2022

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD10B_Envelope_Control_3D_with_Fins.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



From 11 May 2015, all landed housing shall follow the envelope control guidelines which define an allowable building envelope based on storey height and building setbacks. The development shall not exceed the permissible building envelope as illustrated in the figure above.

For existing landed housing approved under previous conventional landed housing guidelines, all new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal.

Building Height

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height and allowable building height in meters.

-   Landed housing shall not exceed the 2-storey or 3-storey height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the existing character1 of landed housing in the neighbourhood.
-   The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the two distinct platform levels.
-   Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

![Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Bungalows/LHD11-Envelope-control-2styedited10aug21LHD09A-Envelope-control-2sty.jpg?h=327&w=799)

1 Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (eg Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

@ The absolute technical height (based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence, if it is stricter than any the other height controls.

Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on the front façade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential living.

![Image 4: Guidelines for mezzanine floor](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD17_Mezzanine.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Attics

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

Basements

Basements may be built up to the limits shown in the table below.

**Basement setbacks**

<table><tbody><tr><td style="width: 20%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Type of Basement</strong></td><td style="width: 40%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Setback from Road Reserve<sup>2</sup> Line</strong></td><td style="width: 40%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Setback from Other Boundaries</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Basement with protrusion</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the road buffer</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the building setback</td></tr><tr><td>Fully submerged basement</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the road reserve line, provided the portion underneath the green buffer is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level</td><td style="text-align: justify;">For plots outside GCBA, up to the site lot boundary, provided:<br><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">the portion underneath the 2m tree planting strip is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">there are no technical requirements (eg sewerage, drainage) and the basement does not cause any adverse impact to the adjoining property;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site.</li></ul>For plots within GCBA, fully submerged basements shall be setback 2m from the boundary lines.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

#### Basements in Low-lying Areas

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)3 shall be treated as a basement storey and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

-   Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings4.
-   Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for the site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m above the external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be built up to the site lot boundary.

![Image 6](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD16_Height_MPL_2D.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



3 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

4 If external openings are proposed, additional requirements from PUB shall be complied with, as follows:

-   The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the adjacent road level; and
-   Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be located above the MPL.

#### Basements on Sloping Sites

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure below as long as the basement protrusion is kept within the permissible Envelope Control building height.

![Image 7: Basement on Sloping Sites](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD15_Envelope_Control_Sloping_Sites.jpg?h=43%25&w=100%25)

 





## Earthworks

title: Earthworks

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Earthworks

date: 5 July 2019

---


Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Earthworks involving earthcut or earthfill shall be minimised to avoid excessive changes to the existing terrain. The scale of earthworks allowed would depend on the location and purpose of the proposed earthworks. All proposed earthworks shall be evaluated to ensure they are sensitive to the wider site context and its impact to the surrounding developments.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD08_Earthworks_Allowable_Earth_Cut.jpg)



Earthworks for the entire development site

Earthworks to raise the existing platform level of the entire development site are generally not allowed. This is to avoid creating new retaining walls.

Earthworks within the building setback area

Earthworks are generally not allowed within the road buffer/building setbacks. Any proposed earthworks shall be assessed based on site context. Where allowed, they shall not exceed 1m.

Earthworks of more than 1m to meet PUB's minimum platform level (MPL)1 shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal. Refer to earthworks in low-lying areas sub-section.

Earthworks may be considered to:

-   Create a vehicular access of maximum **4m** wide.
-   Match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites.
-   Create a workable platform level to mitigate level differences within an undulating or sloping site, or between the site and road.
-   Facilitate building of a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback distances shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Earthworks within the buildable area (ie outside the building setback areas)

The proposed earthworks shall be evaluated in relation to the permissible building envelope under the [Envelope Control guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/EC).

Earthworks in low-lying areas

For low-lying sites that need to meet PUB's minimum platform level (MPL):

-   Only the building structures or internal living areas and setback areas from common boundaries shall be raised to meet the stipulated MPL.
-   The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to the required MPL. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower than the existing ground level, whichever is higher.
-   Any common retaining-cum-boundary walls or fences shall be designed sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of adjacent houses or land parcels.
-   The following condition shall be annotated on plans: "The Developer/Owner is fully aware that he shall raise the structures/areas built to lower platform levels, to or above the recommended Minimum Platform Level as and when the adjacent grounds/roads are raised in future and comply with any other conditions deemed necessary by PUB."

Refer to [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/EC) section for more information on the treatment of internal areas below the MPL.

A bungalow is a detached landed house with its own land title1. It may be built in areas designated for landed housing developments or on land zoned for residential use if the development site area meets the minimum plot size, plot width and site coverage requirements for a bungalow development.

Bungalows may be built in any designated landed housing area, including semi-detached housing or mixed landed housing areas. In Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA) or in other bungalow areas, only bungalow developments are allowed.

At the individual plot level, a bungalow development shall adhere to the envelope control guidelines. These guidelines set out the allowable building envelope based on applicable storey height controls and building setback requirements. The allowable Gross Floor Area (GFA) for landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and envelope.

1 Bungalows may be strata-titled when approved as strata bungalows – refer to [Strata Landed Housing handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing) for guidelines and requirements.

The prevailing landed housing planning guidelines and requirements shall also apply.





## Open Space Provision
---
title: Open Space Provision

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Open-Space-Provision

date: 5 July 2019

---


The National Parks Board (NParks) requires new landed housing development clusters of a certain total Gross Floor Area (GFA) to set aside an open space plot at a rate of 4**.**05sqm of open space for every 56sqm of gross floor area1. While the minimum open space plot size required is 1,000sqm (ie a landed housing development with total gross floor area of about 13,800sqm would be required to make such provision), NParks may require a smaller open space plot based on the same computation rate depending on the adequacy of open space in the nearby area.

The open space plot shall be vested in the State before the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) issues a Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC). The open space shall be free from encumbrances, unless otherwise specified, before it can be vested in the State.

The open space provided shall be:

-   Suitably located within the proposed development, such that it is conveniently accessible to the public;   
-   A single plot of a regular shape, and not fragmented (eg by road, drain or other reserves); and   
-   Generally flat terrain that is neither low lying nor subject to flooding.

Where the landed housing development cluster abuts an expressway or major arterial road, part of the open space provision may double up as part of the buffer zone provided the:

-   Depth of the open space plot is 3m (minimum); and
-   Configuration or the open space plot is reasonably regular.

1 The Open Space Provision requirements are not applicable for Strata Landed Housing developments. See [Strata Landed Housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing/Site-Coverage) Communal Open Space and greenery provision requirements.





## Plot Size and Width for Bungalows

title: Plot Size and Width for Bungalows

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Plot-Size-Width

date: 8 April 2024

Bungalows (within GCBA) - Variations in plot dimensions

Variations in plot width, depth and size may be considered under the following circumstances.

-   The proposed development site is an in-fill development on an existing plot which is already deficient in plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm).  
-   For proposals arising from amalgamation and subdivision of GCBA lots, only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm) shall be allowed per amalgamation and subdivision proposal. The shortfall in the deficient plot size shall be due to vesting of land for public purpose (eg for road widening), and the shortfall in that plot size shall be less than 10%. All proposed new bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements for GCBs.
-   For proposals arising from a subdivision of GCBA lots containing conserved bungalows, the plot sizes of the new plot and the conserved bungalow plot shall be at least 2,800sqm (after setting aside for road widening/drainage reserve1, etc). Only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (less than 1,400sqm) of not less than 1,000sqm shall be allowed per conserved bungalow. This deficient plot shall be contiguous with the conserved bungalow plot. The proposed new bungalows and the conserved bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements.

1 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

Bungalows (outside GCBA) - Variations in plot width

For bungalow plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in plot width may be considered provided:

-   The average width of the plot remains at least 10m so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
-   The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m; and
-   The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines (eg setback, road buffer, etc).

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, is restricted to one new plot per development provided it is a new residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).





## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/RC-Flat-Roofs

date: 27 June 2022

---


RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height and may be considered beyond the permissible building envelope.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/))

@ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas1 shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    1 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

2.  **Elevated solar panels2 located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Mixed Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
2 A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

3.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels**

The illustrations apply to houses within Designated Landed Housing Areas (DLHAs). For proposals outside DLHAs, the left-behind plot must fulfil the minimum plot size requirement of 1,000 sqm.

Outside GCBA, the redevelopment of other housing forms to Bungalows may be considered under the following conditions:

1.  **From a Semi-detached to a Bungalow**
A semi-detached house may be redeveloped into a bungalow if:

-   It complies with the minimum plot size of 400sqm and plot width of 10m, and
-   The left behind (or remaining) semi-detached unit is capable of being redeveloped into a new bungalow in the future (minimum plot size of 400sqm, plot width of 10m).

2.  **From a Terrace House to a Bungalow**
An intermediate or corner terrace house may be redeveloped into a bungalow if:

-   It complies with the minimum plot width of 10m and plot size of 400sqm, and
-   The adjoining terrace house qualifies to become a new corner terrace unit in future (minimum plot size of 200sqm and plot width of 8m)

Retaining Walls

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

-   Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are impractical.
-   Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate greenery effect, if fronting a road or street.

Boundary Walls

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m high.

The combined height of retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (eg fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.

Setbacks for an existing individual plot outside GCBA with more than one road frontage

For an individual plot with more than one road frontage, the building setback requirements are shown in the figures below.

![Image 4](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD05_Setbacks_Multiple_Road_Frontages.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created) outside GCBA

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones) outside GCBA, the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch which requires a 2.4m setback.

![Image 6](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD07_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

-   It is an already existing plot configuration; not newly created through subdivision,
-   The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
-   The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve2 line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.22 MB), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.05 MB), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf) (PDF, 1.25 MB), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.15 MB), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf) (PDF, 1.18 MB), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part) (PDF, 134 KB), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.11 MB) and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.04 MB). All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg site coverage, envelope control guidelines) shall apply. Refer to the relevant street block plans for the existing estates above in the [Locational Criteria](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Locational-Criteria) section.

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 1

![Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows1/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

1 **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.
