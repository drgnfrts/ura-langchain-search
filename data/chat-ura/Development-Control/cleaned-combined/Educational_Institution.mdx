A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

![Image 1: Illustration of a basement in a hotel development](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Hotel/H11_Basement.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



The physical limit for which the basement may be built up to is shown in the table below.

**Basement Setback**

1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

![Image 1: Setback and buildable area for earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



#### Earthworks within the building setback area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Retaining & Boundary Walls

![Image 2: Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525)



The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;
-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, EI developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

**Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height**

<table><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 50%;"><strong>Proposed Storey Height of Development</strong></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 50%;"><strong>Additional Building Height Allowed</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">7 - 20</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">10.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">21 - 30</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">15.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">31 - 40</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">20.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">41 - 50</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">25.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"> More than 50</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">30.0m</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

1.  Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
2.  Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3.  Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.

Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)

LUSH is a comprehensive urban and skyrise greening programme comprising both Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) requirements and incentives to provide greenery and communal spaces.

The LRA requirements are calibrated by location, GPR and development type. A development may count Sky Terraces, Communal Planter Boxes and Covered Communal Ground Gardens (see Greenery sub-tabs) amongst other features, towards meeting the LRA requirement.

Applicants may refer to the following self-help checklists for the applicable greenery requirements and information to be submitted for assessment: for private developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Private-Developments.pdf) and public sector developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Public-Sector-Developments.pdf).

![Image 1: Landscape Replacement Areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F09_Landscape_Replacement_Small.jpg?h=580&w=1000)  


#### Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) Guidelines in Strategic Areas

Developments in identified **Strategic Areas** shall provide LRA that is minimally equivalent to the development's gross site area, as shown in the table and diagram below. At least 40% of the LRA requirement shall be reserved for softscape (permanent planting) areas. The remaining LRA requirement may be provided as hardscape.

The Green Plot Ratio (GnPR) provides an objective measure of the density of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Image 2: Green Plot Ratio formula](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/GnPR_Calculation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be obtained online from NParks' [Flora Fauna Web](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb) by searching the common or scientific names of plants.

 The LRA requirement is not applicable to conserved buildings in historic conservation areas. URA may exercise flexibility on LRA requirements when evaluating individual developments affected by specific constraints.

The table below shows the guidelines for computation of LRAs in Strategic Areas. LRA in Strategic Areas is the sum of:

-   Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds;
-   Horizontal surface area of the hardscape eg communal facilities, urban farm; and
-   Vertical surface area of green walls and extensive green roofs (if any).

#### Plan Presentation Requirements for Landscape Replacement Areas

A Landscape Plan for all Landscape Replacement Areas shall be submitted together with the Development Application, as illustrated below.





The plans shall include:

-   Relevant plans, cross sections and perspectives with layouts of the softscape and hardscape areas. The softscape and hardscape areas shall be visually differentiated on plans with the following details:
    *   Computations of the overall LRA, softscape areas and Green Plot Ratio;
    *   Proposed schedule and annotation of plant species and paving materials;
    *   Where relevant, annotations of ancillary uses eg Swimming Pool, BBQ Area, etc.;
    *   Where relevant, annotations of the 45-degree line;
    *   Short statement on the proposed maintenance and irrigation methods for the planting.

Label and package the landscape plans and sections separately from the rest of the floor plans, and separate the softscape and hardscape areas into different layers.

URA's approval is required if there are changes to the softscape areas (eg planting and structure of the planting beds) and hardscape areas that result in an overall reduction in area for the required LRAs.

URA's approval is not required for changes to the planting species as long as the softscape and Green Plot Ratio requirements are complied with.

The following table for GnPR computation shall be filled in and submitted together with the landscape plans.

#### Communal Planter Boxes

Communal planter boxes shall comply with the following criteria:

-   Maximum width of 1m;
-   Minimum depth of 500mm (for planting purpose);
-   To be sufficiently externalized.

Communal planter boxes which are more than 1.0m wide may be allowed if the wider planter boxes are part of an overall scheme with design merit.

Details of the communal planter boxes, including planting palette, spot sections showing soil depth, and dimensions shall be provided as part of the storey plans.

Communal planter boxes shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

#### Covered Communal Ground Gardens

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1st storey. The garden should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

1.  Predominant C2G2s shall occupy at least 50% of the first storey building footprint. Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped, while the remaining 40% can be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces, and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds, and covered pools. Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping.
2.  Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be exempted from GFA computation up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The GFA-exempted communal areas within the 45-degree line shall contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

All areas of C2G2 spaces shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

For GFA exemption for C2G2, refer to the [GFA handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area). URA will assess the C2G2's design, spatial quality and overall integration with the wider landscaping scheme in considering the proposal's eligibility for GFA exemption.

A landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the Development Application for the predominant covered ground garden proposal, showing the proposed landscaping scheme.

#### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to the pavilions shall be from the common areas only.

In addition to being sited within lushly landscaped areas, they shall satisfy the criteria below to qualify for GFA exemption:

Educational Institutions comprise educational facilities like kindergartens, primary/secondary schools, polytechnics, junior colleges, institutes of technical education, training institutes, universities, foreign and special schools (eg school for the disabled). They are primarily for educational purposes and are zoned "Educational Institution" (EI) in the Master Plan.

For planning purposes, dancing schools, computer schools, tuition centres are treated as commercial schools. As such, they are zoned "Commercial" in the Master Plan. Commercial schools and tuition centres are therefore not allowed in EI zone.

The planning parameters and guidelines here are applicable to all EI developments except for special education schools which have different requirements given the nature of the use. The detailed parameters for special schools are under the tab [Special Education Schools](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/EI/Special-Education-Schools).





## Parking

title: Parking

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/EI/Parking

date: 31 August 2023

---


LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle1 parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

1 Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

![Image 1: Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



New EI developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.





## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/EI/RC-Flat-Roofs

date: 22 February 2024

---


RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

@ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 500sqm1 or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

1 The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
2.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas2 shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    2 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

2.  **Elevated solar panels3 located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Mixed Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
3 A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

3.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 20%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 80%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Guidelines</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Extent</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Height</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Maximum 5m above roof level</td></tr></tbody></table>

All EI developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All EI developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below. Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Geylang area or the Central Area, both of which are guided by Urban Design guidelines.

Special education schools provide training for the disabled aged 1 – 18 years old. Special education schools may be classified as:

-   **Ambulatory**: these schools are for the mentally challenged, visually handicapped, and the hearing impaired.
-   **Non-ambulatory**: these schools are for the orthopaedic impaired or multi-handicaps.

Conversions to Special Education Schools

Conversions of properties to special education schools are evaluated depending on merits. Purpose-built special education schools are allowed on land zoned "Educational Institution".

All parameters and considerations applicable to other EI developments shall apply to special education schools except for those listed below.

Gross Plot Ratio & Building Height

![Image 1: Requirements for special education schools](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/E05_Special_Education_Schools.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



The allowable GPR for special education schools is 0.5 (minimum).

The allowable number of storeys for ambulatory schools is 4 (maximum). The allowable number of storeys for non-ambulatory schools is 2 (maximum).

The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

The allowable floor-to-floor height for special education schools is 5.0m (maximum).

For mixed ambulatory and non-ambulatory school, the non-ambulatory facilities shall be sited on the lower floors to facilitate easier movements for the students.

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 1

![Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows1/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

1 **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.

title: Students' Hostels

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/EI/Students-Hostel

date: 5 July 2019

---


A students' hostel or dormitory is used for lodging by students unrelated by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship. The premises are considered as students' hostel if:

-   The total number of students staying in the premises exceed 6 students; and
-   The premises is for accommodation facilities for full time students studying in the local primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and tertiary institutions.

Students' hostels may either be ancillary to the EI development, for eg as a separate dormitory building that serves students/staff of the school or independent developments.

Location

Students' hostel developments may be allowed on sites zoned Educational Institution, Commercial/Residential and Residential with 1st storey Commercial.

Independent students' hostel developments may also be allowed on sites zoned Residential provided that:

-   The site shall not be located in estates safeguarded for landed housing only (eg Good Class Bungalow Areas);
-   The site shall be located at the fringe of non-landed residential estates and in street blocks which already have non-residential uses;
-   The site shall be fronting a category 2 or 3 road; and
-   The amenity of the surrounding areas shall not adversely affected.

Conversions of Existing Flats to Students' Hostel

Conversion of existing flats to students' hostel may be either on an en-bloc or a ‘per floor' basis. Conversion on a ‘per floor' basis (ie all the flat units on the same floor sharing a common staircase or lift access) may be considered only under a single Temporary Permission (TP) regardless of the number of owners involved, provided that it does not result in dis-amenity to other residents.

The students' hostel shall be located below existing residential floors to minimize potential inconveniences and disturbances to the residents.

All owners shall submit a Letter of Undertaking (LOU) that the students' hostel will be run by a single operator. For conversions on a per floor basis, all owners on the floor are to sign the LOU. A fresh LOU shall be submitted for subsequent renewals of the TP.





## Urban Design Requirements
---
title: Urban Design Requirements

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/EI/UD

date: 22 October 2019

---


Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) intentions are to preserve and enhance the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

Developments in Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District and Woodlands Central), may be guided by specific [urban design requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design), where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

Refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design/URA-SPACE/UD-URA-SPACE) for the Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

1.  Urban Design Areas shown in the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design Plan;
2.  Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
3.  Sites that undergo redevelopment or major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning conditions issued for these works;
4.  Other areas as directed and specified by the Competent Authority.

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

1.  1st storey of developments fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
2.  Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments;
3.  Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2nd storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact on the surrounding developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not directly contribute to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause amenity problems to neighbours.

Example of uses that may be considered as Activity Generating Uses (AGUs) are:

-   Shop
-   Showroom/ galleries 
-   Restaurant
-   Pet shop/pet grooming
-   Banks, adjoining or independent ATM clusters
-   Commercial school
-   Childcare centre/kindergarten
-   Gym/fitness centre
-   Visitor Centre/ museum
-   Hotel/ Backpackers' hostel
-   Self-service laundry

The following uses are not AGUs:

-   Office
-   Bar
-   Nightclub
-   Massage establishment
-   LAN gaming centre
