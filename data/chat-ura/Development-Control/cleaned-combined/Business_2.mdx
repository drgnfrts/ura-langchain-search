The White component within industrial developments may be strata-subdivided. The industrial and White uses within B2 developments may be contained in separate buildings provided that there is no land subdivision.

### Guidelines for Allowable Uses

Guidelines on Showroom

Showroom in industrial premises are meant primarily for the display of two categories of products as follows:

-   Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the counter (eg bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle).
-   Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (eg floor tiles)

Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and when the prospective end-user or business operator for the showroom space is known.

Showroom may be considered subject to the following:

-   Showroom shall be confined to the 1st storey of the development.
-   SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Ancillary Display Area

An ancillary display area is meant only for the display of products related to the predominant industrial operations in the development.

Ancillary display area may be considered subject to the following conditions:

-   Displayed products are purely for corporate or demonstration purposes that serve corporate customers of the industrial companies only and not open to public;
-   These products cannot be sold on-the-premises or on site;
-   There shall be no strata-subdivision or sub-leasing of these areas; and
-   Endorsement from relevant agencies (eg HDB & JTC for leased premises; EDB & ESG for private premises) may be required.

SLA may assess such ancillary display areas based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Conversion of Previously-Approved Ancillary Showroom

If an existing industrial development has a previously approved ancillary showroom (now re-termed Display Area), the owner or operator of such ancillary showroom may apply for planning permission to convert it to a showroom in accordance with the showroom definition and guideline stated above.

Alternatively, the previously approved ancillary showroom may be expanded to function as an enlarged ancillary display area in accordance with the current definition for ancillary display area and guideline stated above.

The table below shows what can or cannot be done to a previously approved ancillary showroom.

Guidelines on Industrial Canteen

Industrial canteens within industrial developments may include food stalls, cafeteria, food court primarily to serve workers in the industrial estate and may include members of the public.

These may be approved on Temporary Permission for up to 5 years subject to the following:

-   The size of the industrial canteen is capped at 700sqm or 5% of the total proposed GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
-   SLA may assess such industrial canteens based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Selected Commercial Uses

To provide basic amenities to workers in industrial estates located away from commercial centres, selected commercial uses namely; clinics, banking halls/ATMS, mini marts, fitness centre/gyms, may be considered on Temporary Permission for up to 3 years subject to the following:

-   The industrial development is located within one of the [](/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Outlying_Industrial_Areas_Map.pdf)[outlying industrial estates](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Outlying_Industrial_Areas_Map.pdf) (PDF, 216 KB).
-   The commercial uses are located on the 1st storey of the development.
-   The total GFA of these commercial facilities shall not exceed 200sqm or 10% of the total GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
-   SLA may assess such commercial uses based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

Guidelines on Temporary Workers' Dormitory

Workers' dormitory are premises used to house migrant workers who are engaged to carry out industrial or production or construction activities. Dormitories may comprise new extensions to existing buildings or new building blocks within an industrial development or may be converted from existing spaces within an industrial development.

New workers' dormitories located outside specified areas (refer to Table 1 and 2 below) or renewal of existing dormitories may be considered on Temporary Permission (TP) for up to 5 years subject to compliance with prevailing guidelines and the use not causing disamenities.

To provide more temporary housing options for migrant workers while additional purpose-built dormitories are being constructed, URA and technical agencies will now assess applications for (i) new temporary workers' dormitories and (ii) increase in the number of workers in existing dormitories located within the specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1 below) on individual basis. If supported, the use will be on 3-years TP, and may not be renewed subsequently.



#### Types of Temporary Workers' Dormitories

-   Ancillary dormitories may house only workers employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development and workers who work on-site in the subject development.
-   Secondary dormitories may house workers not employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development as well as workers who work on- and off-site.

#### Location

-   All new proposed workers' dormitories or increase in capacity within industrial developments are assessed on the merits of the case.
-   New applications located within 13 specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1) will only be considered if the proposals meet prevailing guidelines, and can be supported by existing infrastructure as assessed by technical agencies. Please refer to the [circular](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2023/Feb/dc23-03) dated 10 Feb 2023 for more information.
-   Prior clearances from NEA, PUB, SCDF, and LTA shall be obtained before a proposal is submitted to URA for evaluation.
-   New workers' dormitories shall not fall within NEA and SCDF's health and safety buffer zones, sub-areas reviewed by PUB where there are existing sewer capacity constraints or specified areas listed in Table 2 below.

Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

![Image 1: Setback and buildable area for earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



#### Earthworks within the building setback area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Retaining & Boundary Walls

![Image 2: Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525)



The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;
-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

The above are general guidelines for earthworks and retaining walls. For industrial developments, these guidelines will apply differently depending on the type of development on the neighbouring parcels of land.

![Image 3: Earthworks for industrial scenrios where the guidelines apply](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/-/media/52700266ABC24FD5A07E3FFA0FA3A7D0.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25)

1.  Where the boundary is shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park:
    *   The existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply.
2.  Where the boundary is not shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park:
    *   The existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall apply.
3.  Where the boundary abuts a public road:
    *   The existing controls on earthworks, retaining, and boundary walls shall apply.
    *   Earthworks guidelines shall not apply if the development beyond the public road is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park.
4.  Where the boundary abuts a drainage reserve4:
    *   The existing controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply.
    *   Earthworks guidelines shall not apply only if the development beyond the drainage reserve is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park. If the development beyond the drainage reserve is not an industrial development or business park, the earthworks guidelines shall apply.





## Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes
---
title: Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/GFA-Incentive-Schemes

date: 7 July 2022

---


The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Business 2 are:

Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA1. Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

  

<table><tbody><tr><td><span style="color: black;">Residential<a href="file:///C:/Users/urawongyq/Documents/My%20documents/Updates/Flats%20and%20Condominiums%20-%20draft%20edit.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color: black;"><sup>2</sup></span></a></span><br></td><td><span>Condominium and Flats development </span> </td></tr><tr><td><span>Non- Residential</span></td><td><span>Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments </span><br></td></tr><tr><td><span>Mixed use</span></td><td><span>Combination of the above </span><br></td></tr></tbody></table>

  



1Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.

2The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme3. The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.



3Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA's grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA's grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes is summarised at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

#### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

Applicants are to comply with BE ITM outcomes for the bonus scheme based on the [building type](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-building-type.pdf). The specific requirements for the development proposal will be shared in detail as part of the application process to BCA for the Letter of Acceptance.

title: Gross Plot Ratio

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/GPR

date: 5 July 2019

---


The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a B2 development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). This upper bound GPR may not always be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve1 (DR) and/or Road Reserve2 (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

1 **Drainage Reserve**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

![Image 1: Gross Plot Ratio for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



B2-White

B2 sites located next to MRT stations may be zoned B2-W. The white component is to provide flexibility for industrial companies in such locations to accommodate synergistic White uses.

For such B2-W sites, a minimum GPR shall be achieved for the permissible B2 uses first. This minimum GPR for B2 uses is indicated in the square brackets on the Master Plan.

For example, in the map below, the site next to Joo Koon MRT Station is zoned "**2.5 \[B-2.0\] W**". A B2-W site would have an overall allowable GPR of 2.5. A minimum GPR of 2.0 must be achieved and used for industrial purposes before the remaining GPR 0.5 may be unlocked for White uses.

Refer to the section on [Allowable Uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Allowable-Uses) for the list of allowable uses within the White component.

Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses, telecommunication and utility buildings. These developments may be allowed on land zoned Business 1 (B1) or Business 2 (B2).

Depending on the nature of their activities, clean and light industries are allowed in Business 1 (B1) zone. General and special industries are to be located in Business 2 (B2) zone.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 100m nuisance buffer from a B2 zone to the surrounding area. The allowable types of industry or use within industrial developments in B2 zone, based on NEA's nuisance buffer requirements, are listed [here](https://e-services.nea.gov.sg/ias/PublicApplicant/Homepage.aspx).





## Parking

title: Parking

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Parking

date: 28 June 2023

---


LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle1 parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

1 Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

![Image 1: Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



New B2 developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

#### Private Parking Lots

Within multi-user developments, industrial strata units may be allowed to have their own private car/lorry parking lots subject to the following:

-   The private parking lots are surplus parking lots over and above LTA's minimum parking provision;
-   The floor area of the private parking lots shall be computed as GFA under the 40% ancillary quantum of each strata-unit;
-   The private parking lots are physically contiguous to the industrial strata unit.

For approved private car/lorry parking areas that were previously not computed as GFA, they may be converted to other allowable useable area subject to the following:

-   These areas are computed as GFA and the resultant GFA does not exceed the current MP GPR Control for the development site;
-   The proposed conversion is authorised by the MCST via a 90% resolution;
-   The remaining number of parking lots after conversion still meet LTA's minimum parking provision;
-   SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, B2 developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.





## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/RC-Flat-Roofs

date: 22 February 2024

---


RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

@ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 500sqm1 or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

1 The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
2.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas2 shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    2 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

2.  **Elevated solar panels3 located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Mixed Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
3 A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

3.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 20%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 80%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Guidelines</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Extent</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Height</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Maximum 5m above roof level</td></tr></tbody></table>

Developments not listed in the table above may also be required to submit a WCP if they fall under the following criteria:

-   Developments located in car-lite precincts4; or
-   Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, ie within Zone 25; or
-   Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/WCP.jpg)



1 Developments that have a master developer, and consist of two or more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit a WCP at the concept design stage.

2 LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.

3 Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.

4 The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.

5 Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to [LTA's website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for more details.

Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments;
-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers;
-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists; and
-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarised in LTA's Code of Practice ["Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).





## Developments Involving Waterbodies

title: Developments Involving Waterbodies

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Waterbodies

date: 5 July 2019

---


To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces, developments at major waterbodies1 shall observe the design and development application submission guidelines below.

1 Major waterbodies: rivers, canals of at least 17.5m width, reservoirs, and seas.

![Image 1: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C16_Waterbodies_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

![Image 2: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C17_Waterbodies_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Design Guidelines

1.  **Retaining Walls**
Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the following criteria:

1.  Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;
2.  Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;
3.  Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

2.  **Boundary Walls/Fences**
For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence).  
  
For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:

1.  Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall be aesthetically treated.
2.  Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

3.  **Slope**
There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall not exceed 1:2.

4.  **Conservation of Vegetation**
Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved, wherever possible.

Development Application Submission Guidelines

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA, the following shall be provided, where applicable:

-   Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage Reserve2/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;
-   Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing and proposed ground levels;
-   Design details of integration with waterbody including slope, retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type, Screening);
-   Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;
-   [Checklist](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/Forms/Supplementary-forms/waterbodycl.doc) for Waterbodies-related proposals.

2 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

Application of Guidelines

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development application submission guidelines listed above.

#### Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea

For land use planning and development control purposes, the foreshore3 and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward side of the foreshore line4 shall be kept free of structures. Some structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in connection with an approved development (eg marine industries, refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

3 The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.
