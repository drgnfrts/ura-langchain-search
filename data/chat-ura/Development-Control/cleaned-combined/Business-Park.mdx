Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in accordance with NPARKS' guidelines – see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building setback that exceed the requirements in the table below, but are below 6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design and function.

A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

![Image 1: Illustration of a basement in a hotel development](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Hotel/H11_Basement.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



The physical limit for which the basement may be built up to is shown in the table below.

**Basement Setback**

<table><tbody><tr><td style="width: 20%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Type of Basement</strong></td><td style="width: 40%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Setback from Road Reserve Line</strong></td><td style="width: 40%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Setback from Other Boundaries</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Basement with protrusion</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the road buffer</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the building setback</td></tr><tr><td>Sunken basement</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the road reserve<sup>1</sup> line, provided the portion underneath the green buffer is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to the site lot boundary, provided:<br><br><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">the portion underneath the 2m tree planting strip is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">there are no technical requirements (eg sewerage, drainage) and the basement does not cause any adverse impact to the adjoining property;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/BP04_Building_Height.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height1 of BP developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

1 Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

Floor-to-Floor Height

There is no floor-to-floor height control for BPs.

Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

![Image 2: Additional height for sky terrace floors](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C04_Additional_Height_for_Sky_Terrace_Floors.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, BPs with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below.

**Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 50%;"><strong>Proposed Storey Height of Development</strong></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 50%;"><strong>Additional Building Height Allowed</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">7 - 20</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">10.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">21 - 30</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">15.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">31 - 40</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">20.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">41 - 50</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">25.0m</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">More than 50</td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">30.0m</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

1.  Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
2.  Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3.  Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.





## Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/Earthworks

date: 5 July 2019

Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

![Image 1: Setback and buildable area for earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



#### Earthworks within the building setback area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Retaining & Boundary Walls

![Image 2: Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525)



The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;
-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

The above are general guidelines for earthworks and retaining walls. For BP developments, these guidelines will apply differently depending on the type of development on the neighbouring parcels of land.

![Image 3: Earthworks for industrial scenrios where the guidelines apply](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/-/media/52700266ABC24FD5A07E3FFA0FA3A7D0.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25)



![Image 4: Earthworks for industrial scenrios where the guidelines do not apply](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/-/media/2AE61DD2089741BCA6FF3F84120C3A2C.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25)



1.  Where the boundary is shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park:
    *   The existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply.
2.  Where the boundary is not shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park:
    *   The existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall apply.
3.  Where the boundary abuts a public road:
    *   The existing controls on earthworks, retaining, and boundary walls shall apply.
    *   Earthworks guidelines shall not apply if the development beyond the public road is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park.
4.  Where the boundary abuts a drainage reserve4:
    *   The existing controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply.
    *   Earthworks guidelines shall not apply only if the development beyond the drainage reserve is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park. If the development beyond the drainage reserve is not an industrial development or business park, the earthworks guidelines shall apply.





## Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

title: Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/GFA-Incentive-Schemes

date: 7 July 2022

---


The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Business Park are:

Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA1. Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

  

<table><tbody><tr><td><span style="color: black;">Residential<a href="file:///C:/Users/urawongyq/Documents/My%20documents/Updates/Flats%20and%20Condominiums%20-%20draft%20edit.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color: black;"><sup>2</sup></span></a></span><br></td><td><span>Condominium and Flats development </span> </td></tr><tr><td><span>Non- Residential</span></td><td><span>Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments </span><br></td></tr><tr><td><span>Mixed use</span></td><td><span>Combination of the above </span><br></td></tr></tbody></table>

  



1Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.

2The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme3. The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.



3Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA's grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA's grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes is summarised at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

#### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

Applicants are to comply with BE ITM outcomes for the bonus scheme based on the [building type](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-building-type.pdf). The specific requirements for the development proposal will be shared in detail as part of the application process to BCA for the Letter of Acceptance.

title: Gross Plot Ratio

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/GPR

date: 5 July 2019

---


The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a BP development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). The upper bound GPR may not always be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve1 (DR) and/or Road Reserve2 (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

1 **Drainage Reserve**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

![Image 1: Gross Plot Ratio for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)

LUSH is a comprehensive urban and skyrise greening programme comprising both Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) requirements and incentives to provide greenery and communal spaces.

The LRA requirements are calibrated by location, GPR and development type. A development may count Sky Terraces, Communal Planter Boxes and Covered Communal Ground Gardens (see Greenery sub-tabs) amongst other features, towards meeting the LRA requirement.

Applicants may refer to the following self-help checklists for the applicable greenery requirements and information to be submitted for assessment: for private developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Private-Developments.pdf) and public sector developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Public-Sector-Developments.pdf).

![Image 1: Landscape Replacement Areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F09_Landscape_Replacement_Small.jpg?h=580&w=1000)  


#### Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) Guidelines in Strategic Areas

Developments in identified **Strategic Areas** shall provide LRA that is minimally equivalent to the development's gross site area, as shown in the table and diagram below. At least 40% of the LRA requirement shall be reserved for softscape (permanent planting) areas. The remaining LRA requirement may be provided as hardscape.

The Green Plot Ratio (GnPR) provides an objective measure of the density of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Image 2: Green Plot Ratio formula](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/GnPR_Calculation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be obtained online from NParks' [Flora Fauna Web](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb) by searching the common or scientific names of plants.

 The LRA requirement is not applicable to conserved buildings in historic conservation areas. URA may exercise flexibility on LRA requirements when evaluating individual developments affected by specific constraints.

The table below shows the guidelines for computation of LRAs in Strategic Areas. LRA in Strategic Areas is the sum of:

-   Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds;
-   Horizontal surface area of the hardscape eg communal facilities, urban farm; and
-   Vertical surface area of green walls and extensive green roofs (if any).

#### Plan Presentation Requirements for Landscape Replacement Areas

A Landscape Plan for all Landscape Replacement Areas shall be submitted together with the Development Application, as illustrated below.





The plans shall include:

-   Relevant plans, cross sections and perspectives with layouts of the softscape and hardscape areas. The softscape and hardscape areas shall be visually differentiated on plans with the following details:
    *   Computations of the overall LRA, softscape areas and Green Plot Ratio;
    *   Proposed schedule and annotation of plant species and paving materials;
    *   Where relevant, annotations of ancillary uses e.g. Swimming Pool, BBQ Area, etc.;
    *   Where relevant, annotations of the 45-degree line;
    *   Short statement on the proposed maintenance and irrigation methods for the planting.

Label and package the landscape plans and sections separately from the rest of the floor plans, and separate the softscape and hardscape areas into different layers.

URA's approval is required if there are changes to the softscape areas (eg planting and structure of the planting beds) and hardscape areas that result in an overall reduction in area for the required LRAs.

URA's approval is not required for changes to the planting species as long as the softscape and Green Plot Ratio requirements are complied with.

The following table for GnPR computation shall be filled in and submitted together with the landscape plans.

#### Communal Planter Boxes

Communal planter boxes shall comply with the following criteria:

-   Maximum width of 1m;
-   Minimum depth of 500mm (for planting purpose);
-   To be sufficiently externalized.

Communal planter boxes which are more than 1.0m wide may be allowed if the wider planter boxes are part of an overall scheme with design merit.

Details of the communal planter boxes, including planting palette, spot sections showing soil depth, and dimensions shall be provided as part of the storey plans.

Communal planter boxes shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

#### Covered Communal Ground Gardens

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1st storey. The garden should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

1.  Predominant C2G2s shall occupy at least 50% of the first storey building footprint. Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped, while the remaining 40% can be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces, and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds, and covered pools. Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping.
2.  Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be exempted from GFA computation up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The GFA-exempted communal areas within the 45-degree line shall contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

All areas of C2G2 spaces shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

For GFA exemption for C2G2, refer to the [GFA handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area). URA will assess the C2G2's design, spatial quality and overall integration with the wider landscaping scheme in considering the proposal's eligibility for GFA exemption.

A landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the Development Application for the predominant covered ground garden proposal, showing the proposed landscaping scheme.

#### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to the pavilions shall be from the common areas only.

In addition to being sited within lushly landscaped areas, they shall satisfy the criteria below to qualify for GFA exemption:

Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align: justify;">*The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.





## Introduction
---
title: Introduction

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/Introduction

date: 5 July 2019

---


Business Parks (BP) are for businesses engaged in high-technology, research and development (R&D), high value-added and knowledge intensive activities. BPs have the following distinguishing features:

-   A range or variety of activities or uses which are technology and research-oriented industries and non-manufacturing in nature;
-   Have generous and lush landscaping, quality building designs, and wider range and variety of amenities and facilities.

BPs can be developed on land zoned BP and BP-White. The White component is a flexible provision to allow for more GFA quantum to accommodate related uses synergistic with the dominant BP land use zoning. Related uses include residential, office, hotel, sports and recreation uses. The allowable quantum for White use is higher for land zoned BP-White.





## Parking

title: Parking

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/Parking

date: 28 June 2023

---


LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle1 parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

1 Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

![Image 1: Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



#### Provision of Surplus Parking in New Developments

New BP developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

If LTA approves the waiver, surplus parking spaces in new BP developments within 400m of MRT and LRT stations shall be computed as GFA. Each surplus car parking lot shall be computed as 35sqm GFA, that being the average area of a car parking lot inclusive of circulation space. Each surplus motor-cycle parking lot shall be computed as 12sqm GFA.

SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge for the additional GFA arising from the surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, where applicable.

#### Conversion of Surplus Car Parking in Existing Developments

Existing BP developments **within 400m of MRT and LRT stations** may be allowed to permanently convert their surplus car parking spaces^ to other uses.

^With the RPPS, surplus car parking lots in existing developments may arise if the upper bound for the development type is revised downward and/or if developments choose to reduce car parking provision to the lower bound set out by the RPPS.

LTA may consider conversion of car parks up to the lower bound as stipulated in the RPPS. Interested building owners are to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA before submitting a development application to URA.

The conversion of surplus car park may be allowed subject to compliance with ALL of the following:

-   The proposed uses shall be in line with the Master Plan zoning for the site and the planning intention for the surrounding area. The detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
-   The existing infrastructure and traffic network shall be able to support the increase in GFA and uses, and take into consideration proposed measures to mitigate traffic generation.
-   The resultant car parking provision shall be able to support the additional GFA and proposed uses.
-   SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge for the additional GFA arising from the conversion, where applicable. The additional GFA arising from the conversion of surplus car parking, detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
-   Requests for conversion of surplus car parks may not be supported for sites where there are specific conditions imposed in planning approval or the government land sale that restrict the conversion of the surplus car parking spaces, or sites located within or adjacent to Conservation Areas where additional car parking spaces are needed to support the uses within the conserved buildings.

Additional GFA gained via the conversion of surplus car parking spaces shall not be taken into consideration in determining the maximum permissible intensity that may be allowed for the re-development of the site.

Where surplus car parking spaces were allowed by LTA through a waiver application to exceed the upper bound of the Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS) after 1 Feb 2019, the development will not be allowed to convert any of the surplus car parking spaces to other uses.

Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, BP developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

@ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 500sqm1 or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

1 The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
2.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas2 shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    2 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

2.  **Elevated solar panels3 located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Mixed Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
3 A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

3.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 20%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 80%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Guidelines</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Extent</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Height</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Maximum 5m above roof level</td></tr></tbody></table>

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 1

![Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows1/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

1 **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.





## Urban Design Requirements
---
title: Urban Design Requirements

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/UD

date: 13 April 2020

---


Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) intentions are to preserve and enhance the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

Developments in the Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District and Woodlands Central), may be guided by specific [](/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design)[urban design requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design), where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

Refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=urbandesign) for the Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

1.  Urban Design Areas shown in the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design Plan;
2.  Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
3.  Sites that undergo redevelopment or major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning conditions issued for these works;
4.  Other areas as directed and specified by the Competent Authority.

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

1.  1st storey of developments fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
2.  Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments;
3.  Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2nd storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact on the surrounding developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not directly contribute to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause amenity problems to neighbours.

Example of uses that may be considered as Activity Generating Uses (AGUs) are:

-   Shop
-   Showroom/ galleries 
-   Restaurant
-   Pet shop/pet grooming
-   Banks, adjoining or independent ATM clusters
-   Commercial school
-   Childcare centre/kindergarten
-   Gym/fitness centre
-   Visitor Centre/ museum
-   Hotel/ Backpackers' hostel
-   Self-service laundry

The following uses are not AGUs:

-   Office
-   Bar
-   Nightclub
-   Massage establishment
-   LAN gaming centre

For developments on land zoned BP, minimum 85% of the total GFA of the development shall be retained for BP uses. A maximum 15% of the overall proposed GFA may be allowed for White uses.

For developments on land zoned BP-White, the allowable quantum for White use is higher. The remaining GFA shall be retained for BP uses.

For developments on land zoned BP and BP-White, the BP component is subject to a 60-40 sub-quantum control. For example, a site zoned BP with GPR 2.5 shall provide a minimum 85% BP component to ensure:

-   0.6 x 85% = a minimum of 51% of the BP component shall be allocated to predominant uses
-   0.4 x 85% = a maximum of 34% of the BP component shall be allocated to ancillary uses

Business Park (Non-White) Component – Allowable Uses

#### 7 Guidelines on Industrial Canteen

Industrial canteens within BP industrial developments may include food stalls, cafeteria, food court primarily to serve workers in the BP area and may include members of the public.

These may be approved on Temporary Permission for up to 5 years subject to the following:

-   The size of the industrial canteen is capped at 700sqm or 5% of the total proposed GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
-   SLA may assess such industrial canteens based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### 8 Guidelines on Childcare Centre (CCC)

CCCs within BPs are meant to serve parents working in the development. Proposed CCCs may be considered within BP developments, subject to clearances from National Environment Agency and Early Childhood Development Agency. See NEA's webpage [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/development-control/guidelines-for-building-plan-submission) and ECDA's webpage [here](https://www.ecda.gov.sg) for more information.

SLA may assess such CCCs based on Group E Civic and Community Institution rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### 9 Guidelines on Showroom

Showrooms in BPs are meant primarily for the display of two categories of products as follows:

-   Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the counter (eg bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle); and
-   Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (eg floor tiles)

Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and when prospective end-user or business operator for the showroom space is known.

Showrooms may be considered subject to the following:

-   Showroom shall be confined to the 1st storey of the development.
-   SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.     

#### 10 Pollutive Activity

Examples include use or storage of significant quantities of chemicals, use of solid/liquid fuel burning equipment, use of machinery and processes which require pollution control equipment to abate pollution etc.

#### 11 Bad Neighbour Activity

Examples of bad neighbour activities include those involving intense glare or heat exposed to the surroundings, high noise levels, ground vibrations etc.

**White Component**

For BP zone, a maximum of 15% of the overall proposed GFA may be allowed for White uses.

For BP-White zone, the White uses may be more than 15% of the overall proposed GFA.

The maximum allowable White quantum in BP-White varies depending on locational criteria such as public accessibility and compatibility with neighbouring land uses. Sites closer to MRT stations may be allowed to have a larger White quantum.

For example, in the map below, the two sites next to Expo MRT Station are zoned BP-White with an allowable GPR of 2.5. The figures in the square brackets indicate the allowable White quantum as reflected on the prevailing Master Plan. Both sites are allowed a maximum of 40% of the overall GFA for White uses.

Developments not listed in the table above may also be required to submit a WCP if they fall under the following criteria:

-   Developments located in car-lite precincts4; or
-   Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, ie within Zone 25; or
-   Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

![Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/WCP.jpg)



1 Developments that have a master developer, and consist of two or more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit a WCP at the concept design stage.

2 LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.

3 Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.

4 The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.

5 Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to [LTA's website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for more details.

Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments;
-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers;
-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists; and
-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarised in LTA's Code of Practice ["Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).





## Developments Involving Waterbodies

title: Developments Involving Waterbodies

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Business-Park/Waterbodies

date: 5 July 2019

---


To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces, developments at major waterbodies1 shall observe the design and development application submission guidelines below.

1 Major waterbodies: rivers, canals of at least 17.5m width, reservoirs, and seas.

![Image 1: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C16_Waterbodies_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

![Image 2: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C17_Waterbodies_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Design Guidelines

1.  **Retaining Walls**
Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the following criteria:

1.  Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;
2.  Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;
3.  Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

2.  **Boundary Walls/Fences**
For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence).  
  
For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:

1.  Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall be aesthetically treated.
2.  Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

3.  **Slope**
There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall not exceed 1:2.

4.  **Conservation of Vegetation**
Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved, wherever possible.

Development Application Submission Guidelines

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA, the following shall be provided, where applicable:

-   Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage Reserve2/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;
-   Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing and proposed ground levels;
-   Design details of integration with waterbody including slope, retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type, Screening);
-   Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;
-   [Checklist](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/Forms/Supplementary-forms/waterbodycl.doc) for Waterbodies-related proposals.

2 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

Application of Guidelines

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development application submission guidelines listed above.

#### Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea

For land use planning and development control purposes, the foreshore3 and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward side of the foreshore line4 shall be kept free of structures. Some structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in connection with an approved development (eg marine industries, refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

3 The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.
