1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height1 of PW developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

1 Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

Storey Height

The allowable number of storeys for the PW shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. As a guide, depending on the allowable GPR, the corresponding number of storeys are shown in the table below. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography, site condition and the context of the surrounding area.

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/PW/Earthworks

date: 5 July 2019

---


Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

![Image 1: Setback and buildable area for earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



#### Earthworks within the building setback area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Retaining & Boundary Walls

![Image 2: Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525)



The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;
-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.





## Gross Plot Ratio

title: Gross Plot Ratio

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/PW/GPR

date: 5 July 2019

---


The guideline on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for new PWs varies depending on the location and the context of the surrounding area. The allowable GPR in the table below is the upper bound. The actual allowable GPR would depend on the site conditions, traffic situation, impact of the PW on the nearby developments and other agencies' requirements.

**Allowable Gross Plot Ratio**

<table><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Location</strong></td><td style="width: 50%; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Gross Plot Ratio Control</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Within landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to 1.0</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">At the fringe of landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to 1.4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Within HDB estates and in areas with GPR more than 1.4</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to 1.6</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Within or at the fringe of industrial estates</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Up to 1.6</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Within Central Area and within other commercial centres, including party-wall developments such as in Geylang area</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Subject to evaluation and localised urban design guidelines.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  
The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage reserve1 (DR) and/or road reserve2 (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

1 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

![Image 1: Gross Plot Ratio for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



For redevelopment of existing approved PW developments or to carry out major extensions to them, the proposed increase in GPR or Gross Floor Area (GFA) is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the PW, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies such as LTA. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.





## Introduction

date: 5 July 2019

---


Place of Worship developments are zoned PW (Place of Worship) in the Master Plan. These sites are approved specifically for worshipping and they may include purpose-built mosques, churches and temples. All PWs are required to adhere to the development guidelines on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), use quantum, ancillary uses, number of storeys, site coverage, building setback from road and common boundary.





## Parking
---
title: Parking

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/PW/Parking

date: 31 August 2023

---


LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle1 parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

1 Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

![Image 1: Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



New PW developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, PW developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.





## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/PW/RC-Flat-Roofs

date: 27 June 2022

---


RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints@ (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

@ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

Communal Pavilions

Rooftop pavilions are not allowed in PW developments to minimise dis-amenity to neighbouring developments.

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
2.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas1 shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    1 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

2.  **Elevated solar panels2 located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Mixed Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
2 A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

3.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels**

<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 20%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 80%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Guidelines</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Extent</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: justify;">Height</td><td style="text-align: justify;">Maximum 5m above roof level</td></tr></tbody></table>

All PWs shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All PWs fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below. Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Geylang area or the Central Area, both of which are guided by Urban Design guidelines.

1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Special Control Area 2

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows1/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

1 **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.

2 LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.

3 Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.

4 The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.

5 Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to [LTA's website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for more details.

Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments;
-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers;
-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists; and
-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarised in LTA's Code of Practice ["Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).

To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces, developments at major waterbodies1 shall observe the design and development application submission guidelines below.

1 Major waterbodies: rivers, canals of at least 17.5m width, reservoirs, and seas.

![Image 1: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C16_Waterbodies_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

![Image 2: Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C17_Waterbodies_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



Design Guidelines

1.  **Retaining Walls**
Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the following criteria:

1.  Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;
2.  Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;
3.  Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

2.  **Boundary Walls/Fences**
For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence).  
  
For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:

1.  Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall be aesthetically treated.
2.  Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

3.  **Slope**
There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall not exceed 1:2.

4.  **Conservation of Vegetation**
Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved, wherever possible.

Development Application Submission Guidelines

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA, the following shall be provided, where applicable:

-   Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage Reserve2/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;
-   Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing and proposed ground levels;
-   Design details of integration with waterbody including slope, retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type, Screening);
-   Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;
-   [Checklist](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/Forms/Supplementary-forms/waterbodycl.doc) for Waterbodies-related proposals.

2 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

Application of Guidelines

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development application submission guidelines listed above.

#### Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea

For land use planning and development control purposes, the foreshore3 and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward side of the foreshore line4 shall be kept free of structures. Some structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in connection with an approved development (eg marine industries, refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

3 The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.
