Elevated Linkways Connecting to Pedestrian Overhead Bridges

Elevated linkways connecting to pedestrian overhead bridges are excluded from GFA if they are at least 2.5m in width.

Jurong Gateway Elevated Pedestrian Network

Elevated pedestrian linkages within developments that are identified as key connections under the Jurong Gateway Elevated Pedestrian Network Plan (JGEPN) are excluded from GFA if they comply with the following requirements:

-   The clear width of the walkways shall be a minimum of either 5.0m or 6.0m, as shown in the [](/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2015/Mar/dc15-03app2.pdf)[JGEPN](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2015/Mar/dc15-03app2.pdf). Elevated walkways exceeding the required width may be excluded from GFA depending on merits of the proposal;
  
-   Vertical circulation points that connect the Elevated Pedestrian Network (EPN) with the at-grade pedestrian network shall be provided along the EPN at locations shown in the [](/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2015/Mar/dc15-03app2.pdf)[JGEPN](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2015/Mar/dc15-03app2.pdf) via stairs, lifts and/or escalators;
  
-   The walkway shall be open and accessible to the public during the opening hours of the MRT. Portions of the EPN that also function as public pedestrian overhead bridges (POB) across public roads shall always be accessible to the public;
  
-   The internal walkway route within the building that links the connection points with adjacent buildings shall be as direct as possible. A winding internal walkway route provided with the intention of maximising pedestrian flow to retail or other commercial uses for commercial considerations shall be deemed an internal corridor space and included as GFA;
  
-   The walkway shall be used strictly for pedestrian movements only. Commercial uses are not allowed within the walkway; and
  
-   Way-finding signages within the elevated walkway shall comply with the guidelines stated in the J-Walk Signage Guidelines. Generally, clear and prominently displayed signage shall be provided at the entrances of the elevated walkways within a development to inform pedestrians that they are accessible for public use. Adequate signage along the EPN shall be provided to guide pedestrians to the MRT Station and other key developments along the EPN.

Through-Block Links

Through-block pedestrian links are excluded from GFA if they comply with the following requirements:

-   The pedestrian link shall run through a building block and connect two parcels of public areas (ie main road (excluding service road and back lane), public pedestrian promenade /mall and public open space/landscaped area);
  
-   The internal clear width of the pedestrian link shall be at least 4.0m but no more than 7.0m;
  
-   Changes in the floor levels of the linkage shall be accommodated by ramps; and

-   The pedestrian link shall always be kept open for public use. Clear and prominent signages with minimum size of 4.0m2 shall be displayed above the entrances to inform the public that the linkage is open 24 hours for pedestrian use.









Underground Pedestrian Links to Rapid Transit Stations

Underground pedestrian links are excluded from GFA if they have a clear pedestrian walkway width of:

-   Between 6.0 – 7.0m for walkway without shops or with shops on only one side; or

-   Minimum width of 7.0m for walkway with double-loaded uses.

Walkways greater than 7.0m wide may be excluded from GFA depending on the merits of the proposal.

Upper Level Pedestrian Linkways (Across Different Developments)

Upper level pedestrian links between different developments are excluded from GFA if they comply with the following requirements:

-   The link shall connect two common public areas at upper floors and be used for circulation only;
  
-   The link shall span across a minor road. However, links that span across the development boundary may be considered;
  
-   The internal clear width of the link shall be at least 4.0m and up to 7.0m. If the connection is to a pedestrian overhead bridge, the minimum width shall be 2.5m; and
  
-   The link shall remain open during normal business operation hours for public use. The link shall be directly accessible via lifts or staircases from the 1st storey public lobby.
