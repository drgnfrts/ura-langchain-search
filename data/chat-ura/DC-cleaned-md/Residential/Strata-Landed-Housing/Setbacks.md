Building Setback

![Building Setback](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SL03_Road_Buffer_Setbacks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

These guidelines are applicable to residential developments comprising strata landed housing only.

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

The building setback controls of strata landed housing developments from public roads shall be determined by the road buffer as shown in the table below. Where the strata landed housing development site fronts two or more public roads, the buffer requirements from the roads shall be applied to all boundaries fronting roads.

Road Buffer and Green Buffer requirements

| Road Category                | Road Buffer and Green Buffer     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Category 1                   | 24m (including 5m green buffer)  |
| Category 2                   | 12m (including 5m green buffer)  |
| Category 3 - 5 and slip road | 7.5m (including 3m green buffer) |

### Common Boundaries Setback and Planting Strip

Any strata unit within the development site shall be set back 3m (minimum) from the common site boundary with another development.

A wider setback shall be required for 3-storey strata landed housing sharing a common boundary with Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA).

### Setback of Strata Landed Housing from Common Boundaries

| Strata Landed Housing Storey Height | Minimum Setback from Common Boundary with GCBA Plots | Minimum Setback from Common Boundaries (All other developments) |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 2 storeys\*                     | 3m (including 2m green planting strip)               | 3m (including 2m green planting strip)                          |
| 3 storeys                           | 25m (including 2m green planting strip)              | 3m (including 2m green planting strip)                          |

\*Roof terrace(s), if proposed, shall be orientated to face away from the GCBA.

### Ancillary Structures

Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures

![Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SL04_Setbacks_Ancillary_Structures.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for ancillary structures shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer and tree-planting strip may be assessed in accordance with the objective-based guidelines administered by NParks – see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building setback that exceed the requirements in the table above, but are below 6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design and function.

### Minor Building Appendages

Maximum allowable protrusion into road buffer and common boundary setbacks

While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.

| Appendage                                                                                                               | Within GCBA                                                 | Outside GCBA                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main roof eaves(1)                                                                                                      | Into road buffer: 2m, Into common boundary setback: 1.4m    | Into road buffer: 2m, Into common boundary setback: 1m               |

### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Secondary roof eaves may only extend 1m beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): The maximum projection (i.e. 1m or 1.4m) into the road buffer or into the common boundary setback applies to retractable awnings when they are fully stretched out (i.e. not when the awnings are in their retracted positions).
- (3) Minor decorative feature examples includes light weight cantilevered screens spaced apart for sun-shading purpose without vertical supports. All such structural projections shall not exceed 500mm in depth.
- (4) Planter Boxes: cantilevered box structures for planting purposes.
- (5) Bay Windows: Raised windows not exceeding one structural bay width and cantilevered at least 0.5m high from the floor.
