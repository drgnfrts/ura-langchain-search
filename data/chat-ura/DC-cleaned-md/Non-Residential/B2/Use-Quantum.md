### Introduction

At least 60% of the total B1 industrial GFA (ie minimum 60%) shall be used for industrial purpose(1). The remaining 40% may be used for ancillary (or supporting) uses. Tables 1 and 2 below shows the applicable use quantum control for a single-user or multi-user industrial development.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): This is also applicable to to B1-White sites.

### Single User Development

![Single-User Use Quantum](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/B107_Single_User_Quantum.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Single-User Use Quantum:

- Predominant: Minimum 60%
- Ancillary: Maximum 40%

Single-user/owner developments (i.e. not strata subdivided) that sub-lease space to other tenants are subject to the same quantum controls as multi-user developments (see Table 2 below).

#### Definitions and Notes

- Note: For single-user developments, strata subdivision is not allowed. Sub-leasing of space is allowed.

## Multi-User Development

Multi-User Development Overall Use Quantum

Use Quantum within each Strata Unit

![Use Quantum within each Strata Unit](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/B106_Multi_User_Quantum_B.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

| Type                        | Predominant | Ancillary   |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Entire Development          | Minimum 60% | Maximum 40% |
| Each Strata-subdivided Unit | Minimum 60% | Maximum 40% |

Up to 40% of the floor area of the development is for ancillary quantum at the development level, which comprises all common areas outside the units (such as common corridors, staircases, lifts, toilets, M&E spaces) and all secondary uses (see the _'Guidelines for Allowable Uses'_ section [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B1/Allowable-Uses)).

Within each strata-subdivided industrial unit, at least 60% of the floor area shall be used for industrial uses. Ancillary uses (e.g. ancillary office, meeting rooms) shall not occupy more than 40% of the unitâ€™s floor area.
