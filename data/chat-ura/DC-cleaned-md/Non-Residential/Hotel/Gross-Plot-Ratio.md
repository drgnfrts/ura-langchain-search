The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a hotel development is specified in the Master Plan. The GPR is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of site limitations like the shape of the plot, site topography, or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height, or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

If the GPR is not specified in the Master Plan, the allowable GPR would be determined taking into consideration the location, site context, traffic, and the impact of the hotel development on the surroundings.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve(1) (DR) and/or Road Reserve(2) (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR â€“ see figure below.
