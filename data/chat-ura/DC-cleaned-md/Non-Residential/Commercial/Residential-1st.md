Commercial uses at the basement and upper floors may be considered for developments located within the Central Area or if the development is within a mixed use area fronting major arterial routes outside the Central Area. Proposals to transfer commercial uses to the other storeys shall be evaluated depending on merits, taking into consideration the location, site context, traffic, and impact on the surroundings.

If permitted, proposals to transfer commercial uses to the other storey shall comply with the following guidelines:

- Total commercial quantum shall not exceed the maximum commercial quantum allowed at the 1st storey;
- There shall be commercial uses at the 1st storey fronting the street;
- The commercial areas shall be contiguous;
- There shall be a clear separation between the commercial and residential uses;
- The commercial uses shall be kept within the minimum height of the building edge for the streetblock or 4-storeys, whichever is applicable; and
- The commercial uses shall not create disamenity to the adjoining residential use

### Use Quantum and Allowable Uses

The allowable commercial quantum is determined by the 1st storey building footprint.

Commercial uses that are likely to cause disamenity to the residents are not allowed. Examples of such commercial uses include night clubs and karaoke bars.
