### Retail Unit Size

The average retail unit size shall not be less than 50sqm. Average retail unit size is determined using the following formula:

The width requirements for internal corridor are dependent on the number of commercial units it serves, and are detailed in the table below.

### Internal Corridor Width

| Type of Corridor                           | Primary Corridor(1) (with expected high footfall) | Secondary Corridor(2) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Single Loaded (single row of retail units) | 2.4m                                              | 2.0m                  |
| Double Loaded (retail units on both sides) | 3.0m                                              | 2.4m                  |

For other types of corridor width requirements, refer to relevant guidelines (e.g., BCA Approved Document and SCDF Fire Code). Where a corridor is required to fulfill other functions (e.g., Accessible Corridor), the minimum corridor width shall take reference from whichever corridor width requirement that is greater.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Primary corridors are thoroughfares where high foot traffic is expected. These are typically the routes between the main entrances and exits of the development. Each commercial development shall provide at least 1 primary corridor and indicate this on the plan.
- (2): Secondary corridors refer to all other corridors.
- Note: A wider corridor width may be required for corridors with expected heavy pedestrian traffic.
