### Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height of PW developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

### Storey Height

The allowable number of storeys for the PW shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. As a guide, depending on the allowable GPR, the corresponding number of storeys are shown in the table below. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography, site condition, and the context of the surrounding area.
