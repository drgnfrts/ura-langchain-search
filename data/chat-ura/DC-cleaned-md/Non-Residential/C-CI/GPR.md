The guideline on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for new Civic and Community Institution (C&CI) developments shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. The allowable GPR in the table below is the upper bound. The actual allowable GPR would depend on site conditions, traffic situation, impact of the C&CI development on the nearby developments and other agencies’ requirements.

### Allowable Gross Plot Ratio

| Location                                                                                                           | Gross Plot Ratio Control                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Within landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4                                     | Up to 1.0                                        |
| At the fringe of landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4                           | Up to 1.0                                        |
| Within HDB estates and in areas with GPR more than 1.4                                                             | Up to 1.4                                        |
| Within or at the fringe of industrial estates                                                                      | Up to 1.4                                        |
| Within Central Area and within other commercial centres, including party-wall developments such as in Geylang area | Subject to evaluation and localised urban design | guidelines. |

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage reserve(1) (DR) and/or road reserve(2) (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

GPR for sites where vesting is required

For redevelopment of existing approved C&CI developments or to carry out major extensions to them, the proposed increase in GPR or Gross Floor Area (GFA) is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the development, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

- (2) **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
