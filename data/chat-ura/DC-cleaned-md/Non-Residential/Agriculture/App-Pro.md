### Land Leased or Sold by the State for Agriculture Use

Development proposals involving single storey structures not exceeding 12m in height shall be authorised, ie there is no need to submit an application to URA for planning approval. This is provided there is no retail / F&B (i.e. shop, restaurant, showroom use) or visitor centre use; and the structures comply with the minimum building setback / road buffer set out in the planning guidelines for agriculture developments. The proposed works may start after written consent is obtained from the lessor.

For development proposals involving structures that exceed 1-storey or 12m in height, and fully comply with planning guidelines for agriculture development and lodgement criteria, applicants may engage a Qualified Person (QP) to lodge their plans with URA for a flat fee for instant approval. The works can proceed immediately.

Proposals that do not satisfy the authorisation or lodgment criteria will have to submit a development application with the requisite fees to URA.
