date: 2 December 2021
---

To ensure that the uses proposed in an agriculture development conforms to the agriculture zoning of the land, only certain types and quantum of ancillary and non-agriculture uses may be allowed.

The quantum for ancillary office, workers’ quarters, production-related ancillary use (e.g. R&D, food processing) and other non-commercial ancillary uses supporting the operations of the agriculture use shall adhere to the quantum supported by the lessor of the land (e.g. Singapore Food Agency, National Parks Board, or Singapore Land Authority).

Covered greenhouse / farm spaces shall be computed as GFA. Netting over plants will not constitute covered areas and will not be computed as GFA.

The GFA for retail / F&B use (restaurant, showroom, and shop) shall be capped at 200 sqm maximum.

The GFA for visitor centre use shall be capped at 200 sqm maximum.

Residential dwelling houses or units for the owner’s own dwelling purpose shall not be allowed in agriculture developments.

### Land Leased or Sold by the State for Agriculture Use

Development proposals involving single storey structures not exceeding 12m in height shall be authorised, ie there is no need to submit an application to URA for planning approval. This is provided there is no retail / F&B (i.e. shop, restaurant, showroom use) or visitor centre use; and the structures comply with the minimum building setback / road buffer set out in the planning guidelines for agriculture developments. The proposed works may start after written consent is obtained from the lessor.

For development proposals involving structures that exceed 1-storey or 12m in height, and fully comply with planning guidelines for agriculture development and lodgement criteria, applicants may engage a Qualified Person (QP) to lodge their plans with URA for a flat fee for instant approval. The works can proceed immediately.

Proposals that do not satisfy the authorisation or lodgment criteria will have to submit a development application with the requisite fees to URA.

#### Criteria for the Agriculture Plan Lodgment Scheme

##### List of Lodgment Criteria

1. Land is leased by the State or a statutory body for Agriculture development except for works within the boundary as shown in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Plan-Lodgement/Lim-Chu-Kang-Height-Control-Plan.jpg), which will require a Development Application to be submitted.

![Building Setback](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Agriculture/Agriculture-Building-Setback-Illustration-2.jpg)

All Agriculture developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve(1) line or boundary line to the external wall of the agriculture building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All Agriculture developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the road category. The classification of the road category may be obtained from LTA's Road Interpretation Plan (RIP). A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

**Road Buffer and Green Buffer**

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Agriculture/Earthworks
date: 20 September 2019

### Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

All earthworks (ie earth cut or earth fill) will require endorsement and clearances from the lessor, SFA, and PUB.

Planning permission is required if earthworks cause the level of any point in the land to be more than 1.5 metres above the lower of the following:

1. the level of that point in the land at the time when the land was leased or agreed to be leased by the State or statutory body; or
2. the level of any point at the abutting edge of abutting land

Earthworks on a smaller scale than the above may qualify for the agriculture plan lodgment scheme.

The digging of wells and ponds on agriculture land is authorised and do not require planning permission.

Earthworks are generally not encouraged, except in the following circumstances:

- When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
- When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;

#### Earthworks within the buildable area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the buildable area of more than 1.5m are subject to evaluation depending on merits.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to PUB Minimum Platform Level (MPL)(1).

### Retaining & Boundary Walls

Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls

![Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Agriculture/Allowable-Height-of-Retaining-and-Boundary-Walls.jpg)

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet the following requirements:

- the height shall be less than 1.5m;
- retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered because of site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
- the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory measures, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area the development uses.

Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).
