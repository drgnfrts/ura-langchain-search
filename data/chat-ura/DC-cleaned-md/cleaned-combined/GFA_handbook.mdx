### Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2)

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1<sup>st</sup> storey. Such gardens should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1<sup>st</sup> storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2: Secondary C2G2 and Predominant C2G2.

All areas of the C2G2 shall be accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future. Covered ornamental pond/ reflective pool that forms part of the communal landscape areas may also be considered as part of the C2G2.

A landscape plan showing the proposed landscaping scheme and areas within/beyond the 45-degree line shall be submitted as part of the development application for assessment of the proposed C2G2.

### Secondary C2G2

Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be excluded from GFA up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The communal landscaped areas excluded from GFA within the 45-degree line must be unenclosed, accessible and contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

![Secondary C2G2 (view high-res illustration)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-14-Secondary-C2G2.jpg)

![Secondary C2G2 (Section)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-15-Secondary-C2G2-section.jpg)

### Predominant C2G2

For Predominant C2G2, the additional covered areas beyond the 45-degree line may be considered for exclusion from GFA if the spaces provide substantial ground greenery with good spatial quality.

For on-ground greenery to qualify as a Predominant C2G2, it shall comply with the following requirements:

- The covered garden area should occupy at least 50% of the 1st storey building footprint;
- Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped while the remaining 40% shall be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds and covered ornamental pools.
- Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping;
- Both the covered and uncovered landscaped area shall include suitable varieties of plants which are planted in permanent and preferably sunken planting beds to enhance the spatial and visual quality of the space.
- As the communal landscaped areas are intended to serve the public and/or building users, they shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development1. They should also not be tucked away in dark/obscure corners which will not be conducive for landscaping as well as public use.

While uses like ORA may be proposed within the C2G2, the ORA areas would be included as GFA. Appropriate design interventions shall be adopted to minimise easy conversion of areas excluded as GFA to usable commercial spaces subsequently. The C2G2 should not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

### Computation to the Middle of External Walls

GFA is computed to the middle of external walls<sup>1</sup> (excluding the thickness of wall finishes). See illustration below.

![GFA demarcation of external wall excluding finishes](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/71A-GFA-Demarcation-of-external-wall-excluding-finishes_28Jul2023_SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800)

Where there are windows or doors along the external wall, GFA is likewise computed to the middle of these windows or doors. See illustration below.

![Example of GFA demarcation for windows along an external wall](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA--Demarcation-for-windows-along-an-external-wall_31Jul2023.jpg?h=500&w=800)

Where there are other vertical structures (e.g. railings, parapet walls, curtain walls) in-lieu of external walls, GFA will be computed to the middle of the outermost vertical structures. See examples below.

![Scenario 1 – Balcony with railings affixed on top of slab](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/72A-GFA--Scenario-1--Balcony-with-railings-affixed-on-top-of-slab.jpg?h=500&w=800)

![Scenario 2 – Balcony with railings cladded on the side of the slab](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72B-Scenario-2--Balcony-with-railings-cladded-on-the-side-of-the-slab.jpg?h=500&w=800)

There is no need to account for columns, and GFA will continue to be computed to the middle of the external walls.

![GFA demarcation of railings](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/73A-GFA-Scenario-1-Demarcation-of-railings_28Jul2023_SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800)

![GFA demarcation of railings and columns](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/73B-GFA-Demarcation-of-railings----Column-Scenario-2_28Jul2023_SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800)

Where there is a change in wall thickness, a 50mm offset is used to connect the different GFA delineations.

![50mm offset computation change in thickness of wall](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/74-GFA-50mm-offset-computation-change-in-thickness-of-wall_28Jul2023_SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800)

Where there is no external wall or similar vertical structure, GFA will be computed up to the edge of the covered areas.

![GFA cross-section computation without wall or vertical structure](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/75-GFA-cross-section-computation-without-wall-or-vertical-structure28Jul2023SC-03-bay-window-and-bal.jpg?h=500&w=800)

Where a wall is between a GFA space and space that is not computed as GFA (e.g. shop space and common carpark) the extent of the GFA space will be computed to the middle of the wall. See example (A) below.

![GFA cross-section computation between GFA and exempted space](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/76-GFA-cross-section-computation-between-GFA-and-exempted-space28Jul2023SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800)

<sup>1</sup> For buildings with party walls, which refer to the shared wall along the common boundary of two separate developments, GFA computation will include the thickness of the party wall that is part of the building.

### All Strata Areas to be Computed as GFA

All proposed strata areas will be computed as GFA. For example, if an AC ledge serving a residential unit is included as part of the strata area of the unit, the AC ledge will be computed as GFA.

![Example of GFA and strata demarcation in AC ledge](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/77-GFA-Example-of-GFA-and-strata-demarcation-in-AC-ledge.jpg?h=500&w=800)

QPs are to clearly reflect both the GFA and strata boundaries on each of the floor plans submitted to URA, and to ensure all proposed strata areas have been duly computed as GFA. Non-provision of strata boundaries may result in a delay in URA's grant of approval.

Developers are strongly encouraged to involve surveyors early in the design process to firm up the proposed strata boundaries. This is because any proposed changes to strata boundaries downstream may affect the resultant GFA of the development. If this results in the proposed GFA exceeding the Master Plan control, URA will require the proposed GFA to be rectified (e.g. via an amendment application) before strata subdivision approval can be granted.

#### Exceptions where Strata Area Need Not be Computed as GFA

There are some developments (e.g. mixed-use developments) where spaces intended for public/ communal use are included as part of a larger strata area, for the purpose of demarcating ownership and maintenance responsibilities. For example, covered walkways on the 1<sup>st</sup> storey commercial floor, within a larger commercial/residential development or sky terraces on the upper hotel floor, within a larger hotel/office mixed-use development.

Such spaces can continue to be considered for GFA exemption (notwithstanding their inclusion as strata area), subject to compliance with URA's prevailing guidelines for GFA exemptions.

### GFA Apportionment

If the approved development comprises more than one use, the following rules shall apply in the calculation of common areas. Such a mixed development may also arise due to the land use zone, for example the Commercial & Residential zone.

**Attributable space:** Where a common area is exclusively used for a specific purpose, it will be apportioned to the specific use. See example below.

![GFA Apportionment](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72A-Apportionment_Comm_2oct20.jpg)

**Non-attributable space:** Where the common area is used for two or more purposes, it will be apportioned based on the weighted average, pegged to the prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning of the development. See example below.

![GFA Apportionment](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72B-Apportionment-CommResi_2oct20.jpg)

The prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning is detailed below:

#### Master Plan Zoning and Apportionment of Non-Attributable Space

- **Residential with Commercial at 1st storey:** 80% for Residential, 20% for Commercial
- **Commercial & Residential:** 60% for Residential, 40% for Commercial
- **Hotel:** 60% for Hotel, 40% for Commercial
- **White:** 100% for White\*
- **Business Park:** 85% for Business Park, 15% for White\*
- **Business Park – White (X):** (100 – X)% for Business Park, (X)% for White\*
- **Business 1 – White Y[B1-Z]W:** (Z/Y) x 100% for Business 1, (Y - Z)/Y x 100% for White\*

\*Common areas in White sites with a single use will be apportioned to that proposed use. For White sites with multiple uses, non-attributable common areas will be apportioned based on simple average of the uses. The simple average apportionment of common area GFA on "white use" floors will similarly apply to the White components of Business Park, Business Park-White and Business-White zones.

The new apportionment rules will be applied on a per floor basis. If a floor is occupied by a single use (e.g. Commercial), any vertical circulation GFA areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned to Commercial use, though they may also be used by other users (e.g. Residential) above for escape purposes. However, if the floor is occupied by two or more uses<sup>1</sup> for which the staircase GFA on that floor cannot be exclusively attributed, they will be regarded as non-attributable space and apportioned based on weighted average, pegged to the prescribed use quantum in the Master Plan zoning.

The illustrations above are not exhaustive in covering all possible building or layout designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA may, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into consideration and check with URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm the application of the rules on their proposals.

<sup>1</sup> These should comprise actual uses and not common areas. For example, on full Commercial floors with lift lobbies that serve Hotel uses, vertical circulation areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned to Commercial use. However, on mixed floors with both Hotel and Shop uses, vertical circulation areas will be apportioned based on weighted average.

### GFA Apportionment for Sites with Specific Use Quantum Mix in Tender/ Lease Conditions

For sites where the tender or lease conditions state that the land is to be developed for a certain use quantum mix, non-attributable common areas will be apportioned based on the specific use quantum mix stated in the tender or lease conditions, rather than the Master Plan zoning. For example, if the lease conditions for a site zoned Commercial require that the site is to be developed for a use quantum mix of 65% Commercial and 35% Civic & Community Institution, the non-attributable spaces will be apportioned based on 65% Commercial and 35% Civic & Community Institution, rather than 100% Commercial.

For White sites where the tender or lease conditions stipulate a minimum quantum control on a particular use (e.g. minimum 30% Service Apartment), this will be taken into account when apportioning the non-attributable common areas with the balance 70% distributed to the other uses in the development on a simple average basis. For example, if the White site has a requirement of minimum 30% Service Apartment use and the development also has Commercial and Hotel uses, the apportionment of the non-attributable common areas will be based on 30% Service Apartment, 35% Commercial and 35% Hotel.

In evaluating the development applications, URA may, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into consideration and check with URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm the application of the rules on their proposals.

### Re-computation of GFA for Existing Developments

Prior to 1 Sep 1989, the intensity of residential developments was determined using the population density (i.e. persons per hectare) method while that for commercial developments was based on the nett floor area method (i.e. excluding neutral areas). With effect from 1 Sep 1989, the different methods of determining development intensity for different types of development were standardised by the current Gross Floor Area (GFA) method.

To determine the intensity of such developments approved before 1 Sep 1989, there is a need to convert the approved GFA of the developments to the standardised current GFA definition. For such developments, the approved building would need to be recomputed based on the prevailing GFA definition.

As for developments approved after 1 September 1989, the intensity of these developments are already determined using the modern GFA system. Therefore, there is no need to recompute the GFA for such developments.

date: 26 Jul 2023

For development control purpose, Singapore uses a Gross Floor Area (GFA) system to work out the bulk and intensity of a development. The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for a specific development site is defined as the ratio of the GFA of a building to its site or plot area<sup>1</sup>. The allowable GPR of a development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP).

This GFA handbook explains which area or space of a development is included or excluded from GFA for development control purpose. As a general principle, all (a) covered floor area of a development, (b) uncovered area used for commercial purposes, and (c) strata area (covered or otherwise) of a development are included as GFA, unless otherwise exempted. This is regardless of whether the spaces are accessible or usable.

GFA is the total area of covered floor space, including the half thickness of external walls<sup>2</sup> or other building facade elements (e.g. windows, railings, curtain walls), but excluding voids.

### Bonus Gross Floor Area above MP Allowable Intensity

Bonus GFA is allowed over and above the MP GPR subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the GFA incentive schemes shall not be carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.

Although a site may make use of multiple GFA incentive schemes, the total GFA shall not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR. Developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

### Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

- [Residential Developments (Flats and Condominiums)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Bonus-GFA):
- Balcony Incentive Scheme
- Conserved Bungalow Scheme
- Indoor Recreation Spaces Scheme

- [Non-Residential Development (Commercial)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial/GFA-Incentive-Schemes):

### Mechanical and Electrical Rooms within Basement Car Park

M&E rooms (including bin centres and substations) within fully sunken common basement carparks are excluded from GFA.

### Mechanical and Electrical Floors for Hotel and Commercial Developments

Under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) scheme, activity-generating and sustainability-related uses are encouraged on the rooftop of either new commercial and hotel developments or commercial and hotel developments undergoing major additions and alterations / re-development.

Activity-generating uses include F&B and sustainability-related uses include urban farms(1), communal roof gardens, greenery and solar panels.

Rooftop M&E services may be transferred from the roof to **one of the top three floors** directly below the roof and **only one such floor** may be excluded from GFA provided the use of the freed-up roof space adhere to the following requirements:

- The urban farm area, solar panels and communal roof gardens shall take up a meaningful part of the roof. Any M&E services such as lift motor rooms or staircase cores that need to remain on the rooftop shall be clustered and neatly integrated with the roof design. Applicants shall consider the site context in deciding the most appropriate use for the rooftop.
- URA will take into consideration whether the proposed use on the roof top would pose dis-amenity concerns to neighbouring developments (e.g. noise, glare). For example, F&B uses are not allowed on the rooftops of commercial and hotel developments that share common boundaries with residential developments.

Applicants are to take note of the following considerations:

- F&B uses, whether covered or open-to-sky, are to be included as GFA.
- For crop protection, covers over rooftop urban farms may be allowed. Such covered areas are included as GFA;
- Covered spaces under solar panels used for landscaping purpose are excluded from GFA.

Note: Proposals for activity-generating and sustainability-related uses on the roof and the associated GFA exclusion for the M&E services transfer shall be considered based on the merits of the proposal and subject to URA’s evaluation at the development application stage.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Rooftop urban farms come in various forms, ranging from smaller scale community-based farming activity and edible gardens, to larger-scale, highly intensive farming activities conducted on a commercial basis.

### Mechanical and Electrical Spaces Enclosed by Chain Link Fence on Car Park Floors

M&E spaces enclosed by chain-link fencing or low parapet wall on common car park floors (e.g. above basements) are excluded from GFA.

### Roof Covers for the Screening of Mechanical and Electrical Service Equipment

Non load bearing roof covers meant to screen off rooftop services (e.g. M&E and other service equipment) may be excluded from GFA.

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area/GFA/Privately-OwnedPublicSpacesPOPS
date: 4 Jan 2023
---

1st storey covered public spaces may be excluded from GFA under the Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS) scheme if they satisfy the urban design, operational and eligibility requirements below.

### Urban Design Guidelines

#### Size and Configuration

The public space area should be large enough to improve the amenity of the local area and serve as a meaningful space for users. As a guide, the public space area should be at least:

- 1sqm of public space area for every 50sqm of total development GFA; or
- 25% of the development's building footprint (whichever is lower).

Covered public spaces should have high volume of at least two storeys or an appropriate height in proportion to its size. At least 75% of the total public space area should consist of a contiguous space which is regular in shape, subject to detailed evaluation.

#### Access and Location

The public space should be located at the first storey with a frontage onto a major street or pedestrian thoroughfare. The public space frontage should be open and unobstructed to allow for easy pedestrian access and be highly visible from the adjoining street or pedestrian thoroughfare. The access and circulation within the public space should be barrier-free and comply with BCA's universal design guidelines.

#### Public Seating and Amenities

Public seating should be provided. The minimum requirement is one seat per 20sqm of public space area (1m of bench/ledge = 2 seats). A variety of seating to cater to different users, age groups and physical abilities is encouraged, e.g. seats with back and arm rests are highly encouraged to cater to the elderly; movable seats to allow for interaction, etc.

The public space may include other amenities to encourage public use of the space such as:

- Design Features: Public Art, Water Features;
- Furniture + Equipment: Tables, Play/Exercise Equipment, Built-in Lighting and Audio Equipment for events; and
- Services: Drinking Fountains, Wi-Fi Connection, Phone Charging Points.

#### Shade

The public space should be well shaded to encourage public use throughout the day. Shade can be provided by integration within the building form, by adjacent buildings, trees, canopies/pergolas, adjustable umbrellas/awnings, and/or landscape elements. The material used to provide shade must not result in additional heat retention in the public space.

Sun shadow study should be undertaken to demonstrate that sufficient shade is provided between 9:00am and 4:00pm. Shadow diagrams are to be studied for shadow cast on 21 Jun: at 9:00am, 12:00pm and 4:00pm. For each shadow diagram:

- At least 50% of the total public space area is to be shaded; and
- At least 50% of public space seating is be shaded.

#### Signage

An information plaque shall be installed at a visible and fixed location near the main entrance of the public space. The plaque should include the following information:

- Public Open Space logo measuring at least 30 cm by 30 cm;
- "Open to public 24 hours" statement;
- Public space owner and their contact information.
- No smoking sign

Refer to [Annex 1-1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Jun/dc22-07-Annex-1-1.pdf) for the template file in PDF (editable in Adobe Illustrator) and high resolution logo image.

All text on the signage should be highly contrasting with the background colour of the sign, at least 20mm in height, and in a highly legible font. The signage must be constructed of highly durable material such as metal or stone that is fully opaque and non-reflective. The signage should be integrated with other signage in the same vicinity (if any), to reduce visual clutter.

### Operational Guidelines

The public space:

- Must be open to the public at all times;
- Cannot be enclosed and cannot be converted to any other permanent uses in the future; and
- Must remain as common property, in the event of strata subdivision.

ORA within POPS, if any, must remain as common property (i.e. as part of the public space), in the event of strata subdivision.

### Eligibility for GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space

To be eligible for GFA exemption, the first-storey covered public space should be within a development that is frequented by the general public and situated along popular pedestrian routes. These are typically:

- Commercial developments/developments with significant commercial component (e.g. offices, business parks, shopping centres, hotels) or Civic & Community institutions and Educational institutions; and
- Located in Central Area, a Regional/Sub-Regional/Fringe Centre, a Growth Area (e.g. Tampines, Jurong East, Paya Lebar, Woodlands etc.) or a Town Centre.

### Extent of GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space

The GFA exemption applies to the entire covered area of the public space excluding Outdoor Refreshment Areas, if any.

### (Optional) Outdoor Refreshment Area within POPS

#### Definition

An outdoor unenclosed seating area serving a Food & Beverage (F&B) unit.

#### Use

Primarily used for seating. ORA seating is not to be counted towards the required POPS seating provision.

#### Location

To be located within Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) of commercial or mixed-use developments. ORA within POPS should not impede pedestrian movement, obstruct fire engine access, safeguarded through-block links, view corridors and any other public open spaces.

#### Height

Maximum 5m, single storey.

#### Size

The maximum allowable size for ORAs within POPS is up to 10% of the POPS area (see Fig.1); The area of the ORA shall not be calculated as part of the minimum required size for POPS as stipulated in the Design Guidelines for POPS(1). The remaining area of the POPS after deducting the ORA should be equal to or larger than the minimum size required for POPS.

![Fig.1 Illustrated example for ORA within POPS](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-ORA-in-POPS-figure1.jpg)

#### Structure

- Designed as outdoor, unenclosed dining areas;
- Umbrellas, retractable canopies and lightweight structures are allowed;
- Only loose tables, chairs and approved structures by relevant authorities are allowed;
- All furniture or opaque structures should not exceed 1.2m high;
- The extent of the ORAs is to be clearly demarcated with boundary markers which are not easily removable e.g. planters. All structures and furniture, including menu stands, displays and signage, must not encroach beyond the extent of the approved ORA.

#### Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation

Outdoor kiosk for food preparation can be allowed within the ORA boundary if they comply with the following guidelines:

- Ancillary food preparation area up to 30sqm. Larger food preparation areas may be considered on a case-by-case, subject to evaluation;
- No major food preparation is allowed;
- All furniture or opaque panels, including doors and internal partitions should not exceed 1.2m high;
- Up to 4m width, with an additional 1m return, of the lightweight structure (if any) can be walled with full height opaque panels to conceal equipment and storage. A wider width may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to evaluation;
- Designed as contiguous with the seating area;
- For proposals in which an ORA within POPS is integrated with an Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation, the combined seating area and the Outdoor Kiosk should not exceed 150sqm.

#### Signage

Business names are allowed to be displayed on the awnings / structures. Any third-party advertisement signs or sponsor logos are not allowed as freestanding structures or to be displayed on the ORA structures. Any signs will require the written approval of Building and Construction Authority (BCA) prior to the installations.

#### Gross Floor Area

ORA within POPS will be considered as commercial GFA. For developments which have maximised their development potential, the proposed ORA within POPS can be considered over and above the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan for the site, subject to the overall 10% GFA bonus cap<sup>[1]</sup> for each development and the payment of Land Betterment Charge as assessed by SLA.

As per current practice, all additional GFA granted under the bonus GFA incentive schemes will not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional GFA granted under this scheme will not be transferable for other uses elsewhere in the development.

#### Sky Terrace Area as % of Floor Plate

- Sky Terrace: Not applicable
- Predominant Sky Terrace: The sky terrace area within the 45-degree line occupies equal to or more than 60% of the floor plate.

#### Perimeter Openness

- Sky Terrace: At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: At least 60% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is open(1) and unenclosed.

Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to be considered open.

#### Depth of Sky Terrace

The proposed depth of the sky terrace shall be minimally 5.0m throughout.

#### Landscaping

Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. The planting shall be well externalised.

Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the usage of the sky terrace.

As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds up to 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs. This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space.

The sky terraces shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

#### Accessibility and Ownership

The sky terrace shall be accessible to all occupants of the building and there shall be at least one set of communal access via a lift or staircase serving the sky terrace. Secondary access to the sky terrace from strata units can be supported.

The layout of sky terrace floors shall be subject to evaluation to ensure that the sky terrace space is meant for communal use and is not treated as a privatised space. For sky terraces in residential developments that occupy less than 60% of the floor plates, the sky terraces shall serve a minimum of 2 strata units to ensure that they remain as communal space. They shall remain as common property in strata subdivided developments.

#### Drop Panels

Where proposed, drop panels at the perimeter shall be visually transparent and may be in the form of louvres, fins, transparent glass, or other sun shading/weather protective devices. The panel shall not exceed one third of the height of the external opening. The area of GFA exemption(2) as defined by a 45-degree line shall be taken from the underside of any permanent or opaque structure, and not from the underside of a drop panel.

#### Additional Height

- Sky Terrace: Not eligible.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: Refer to Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey sub-section in the Residential and Non-Residential Handbooks.

#### GFA Exemption

- Sky Terrace: For sky terraces occupying less than 60% of the floor plate, the maximum area for GFA exemption of the sky terrace is defined by the area covered by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: URA may grant additional GFA exemption for residual areas beyond the 45-degree line (capped at 20% of the floor plate area), if such areas form an integral part of the sky terrace or are part of the barrier-free/fire escape corridors.

Corridors may be exempted from GFA computation for all sky terraces regardless of size subject to the following criteria:

- The corridor lies within the 45-degree exemption area;
- The corridor serves the sky terrace; and
- At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- The corridor does not serve as the primary access to units located on the same floor as the sky terrace.

#### Submission Requirements

A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for the sky terrace showing the proposed landscaping scheme, planting palette, soil depth and communal facilities shall be submitted as part of the Development Application.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to allow for more openness.
- (2): The 45-degree GFA exemption area may be taken from all external parapet walls (including recessed external parapet walls) surrounding the sky terrace.

Building features which are excluded from GFA can be allowed to extend from the building wall line to serve different needs. These features are typically short appendages and not extensive overhangs.

In situations where one building feature is added on to another, the width of projection of these structures is measured from the building wall line. If the proposed feature as measured from the wall line exceeds the dimension prescribed for exclusion from GFA, it is to be included as GFA as illustrated below.

The width of the projection of each item that is excluded from GFA measured from the external building wall line cannot exceed the maximum allowable width. Otherwise, the entire structure would be included as GFA.
