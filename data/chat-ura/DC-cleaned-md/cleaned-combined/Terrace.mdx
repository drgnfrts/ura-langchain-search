### Vehicular Access to Terrace plot

Only one single vehicular access point shall be allowed per landed housing plot.

Vehicular Access Points

[Vehicular Access Points](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/TH03_Vehicular_Access.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The position of vehicular access point for terrace houses shall consider roadside planting and kerbside parking space provision. For example:

- All vehicular access points for new landed housing developments shall preferably be paired to provide for a sufficiently wide space (at least 6m) between 2 access points.
- Existing vehicular access points already in a paired arrangement today shall not be separated unless there is a separation space of at least 6m.
- Sites with plot width of more than 10m need not pair up their access point with the adjacent unit, if the full continuous 6m planting verge can be provided within the plot width of the site.

### Entrance to a Landed House

Only one main entrance door for a single residential unit for family dwelling purposes shall be allowed in a landed house.



## Additions and Alterations to Landed Housing

link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Additions-Alterations
date: 5 July 2019
---

### Proposals Considered as Additions & Alterations

Proposals shall meet the following criteria to qualify as an Additions & Alterations (A&A) proposal:

- Proposed additional gross floor area shall not exceed 50% of the approved gross floor area;
- External walls that are to be removed and replaced with new walls shall not exceed 50% of the approved external walls;
- Structural changes to the existing landed dwelling house (eg replacing or constructing new columns/beams and reconstructing existing floor slabs) shall not exceed 50% of existing building;
- Changes/replacement of entire roof (with/without resultant increase in height) shall not involve an additional storey;
- Addition of an attic, provided the increase in GFA shall be less than 50%.

### Proposals Considered as Reconstruction

Proposals that do not comply with the criteria for Additions & Alterations shall be considered as Reconstruction proposals. Works resulting in the following outcomes shall also be deemed as reconstruction, regardless of whether the works exceed 50% of the existing building GFA:

- Increase in storey height (including changes/replacement of any part of the roof involving an additional storey);
- Change in landed dwelling housing form (for example, from a semi-detached house to a bungalow).

For existing landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines. Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal to ensure that the outcome is not worse off.

### Retaining Existing Non-Conforming Structures in Additions and Alterations Proposals

URA may consider allowing landed houses undergoing Additions & Alterations (A&A) works or reconstruction to retain non-conforming structures(1), subject to the following requirements:

- At least 25% of the existing floor plate shall be retained, comprising an integrated wing of existing columns, beams, floor slab and external walls that includes the non-conforming portion of the house;
- Submission of a Professional Engineerâ€™s (PE) certification to confirm that structures to be retained are structurally sound, can accommodate the new works proposed, and that appropriate construction methods will be used to ensure that they will not be damaged
- If the existing front setback is deficient, there shall be a minimum absolute 2.4m setback distance provided from the front boundary line. The setback is measured from the boundary of the external wall/glass of the bay window.

URA shall be notified immediately if any of the non-conforming structures approved to be retained are demolished. The Qualified Person appointed by the owner shall make an amendment application for the new works to comply with prevailing DC guidelines, before any new works are carried out on site.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Non-conforming Structures: Structures within the existing house that were approved and built in the past, but do not comply with the prevailing development control guidelines.



## Building Appendages

title: Building Appendages
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages
date: 20 May 2021
---

- All structures shall generally be confined within the envelope. The car porch and patio/terrace area are subject to the setback guidelines shown in the [Building Setbacks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries) section.
- Minor building appendages that do not increase the building bulk may be allowed to encroach slightly into the road buffer and setback areas, as shown in the table below. While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
- Allowable protrusion into the setbacks for other building appendages not covered in the table shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal.

### Car Porch

The height of the car porch shall not exceed 4.5m.

The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall remain open-to-sky and unenclosed.

The required setback for the accessible car porch roof area, when used as open balcony/garden from the common boundaries, shall follow the requisite side/rear setbacks of the main building.

Where one side of the car porch abuts the neighbour's boundary, a 1.8m high light-weight screen wall shall be built along the common boundary of the car porch roof to provide the neighbour with some privacy, unless the adjoining neighbour agrees to do without the screen wall. Examples of light-weight screens include angled louvres or slanted vertical panels.

Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:

- A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and railing)
- A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch roof
- Planters for landscaping

### Minor Building Appendages

Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks.

| Appendage                                                                                                               | Terrace Type I                                              | Terrace Type II                              |

| Main roof eaves(1)                                                                                                      | Into road buffer: 2m                                        | Into common boundary setback: 1m             |
| Ledges or cantilevered awnings(2) (without vertical supports)                                                           | Into road buffer: 1m                                        | Into common boundary setback: 1m             |
| Horizontal sun-shading devices, vertical sun-shading fins/screens, other minor decorative features(3), planter boxes(4) | Into road buffer: 0.5m                                      | Not to encroach into common boundary setback |
| Bay windows(5)                                                                                                          | Not to encroach into road buffer or common boundary setback |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Secondary roof eaves may only extend 1m beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): The maximum projection (i.e. 1m) into the road buffer or into the common boundary setback applies to retractable awnings when they are fully stretched out (i.e. not when the awnings are in their retracted positions).
- (3) Minor decorative feature examples: Fins or light weight cantilevered screens spaced apart for sun-shading purpose without vertical supports. All such structural projections shall not exceed 500mm in depth.
- (4) Planter Boxes: cantilevered box structures for planting purposes.
- (5) Bay Windows: Raised windows not exceeding one structural bay width and cantilevered at least 0.5m high from the floor.
- While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
- If the plot abuts a GCBA plot, the minimum setback is 3m.
- These standards are based on Cat 3-5 roads. Setback requirement for other building features not covered under the table shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal.



## Envelope Control Guidelines

Envelope Control Guidelines

![Envelope Control Guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/TH04A_Envelope_Control_3D_With_Fins.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

From 11 May 2015, all landed housing shall follow the envelope control guidelines which define an allowable building envelope based on storey height and building setbacks. The development shall not exceed the permissible building envelope as illustrated in the figure above.

For existing landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works should comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal.

### Building Height

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height and allowable building height in metres.

- Landed housing shall not exceed the 2-storey or 3-storey height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the existing neighbourhood character(1).
- The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the two distinct platform levels.
- Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

2-storey Envelope Control landed housing

![2-storey Envelope Control landed housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Bungalows/LHD11-Envelope-control-2styedited10aug21LHD09A-Envelope-control-2sty.jpg?h=327&w=800)

3-storey Envelope Control landed housing

![3-storey Envelope Control landed housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Bungalows/LHD12-Envelope-control-3sty10aug21LHD09B-Envelope-control-3sty.jpg?h=373&w=800)

### Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on the front faÃ§ade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential living.

Guidelines for Mezzanine Floor

![Guidelines for Mezzanine Floor](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD17_Mezzanine.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Attics

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

Attic Guidelines

(2) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

#### Basements in Low-lying Areas

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the minimum platform level (MPL)(3) shall be treated as a basement storey and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

- Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings(4).
- Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for the site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m above the external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be allowed to be built up to the site lot boundary.

Basement guidelines for low-lying sites

![Basement guidelines for low-lying sites](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD16_Height_MPL_2D.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)


#### Basements on Sloping Sites

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure below as long as the basement protrusion is kept within the permissible Envelope Control building height.

Basement on Sloping Sites

![Basement on Sloping Sites](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD15_Envelope_Control_Sloping_Sites.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)


### Definitions

- (1) Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - (@) The absolute technical height (based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any the other height controls.
- (2) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
- (3) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1(st) storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).
- (4) If external openings are proposed, additional requirements from PUB shall be complied with, as follows:
  - The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the adjacent road level; and
  - Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be located above the MPL.


## Earthworks

title: Earthworks
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Earthworks
date: 5 July 2019
---

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Earthworks involving earthcut or earthfill shall be minimised to avoid excessive changes to the existing terrain. The scale of earthworks allowed depends on the location and purpose of the proposed earthworks. All proposed earthworks shall be evaluated to ensure they are sensitive to the wider site context and its impact to the surrounding developments.

Allowable Earthworks

![Allowable Earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD08_Earthworks_Allowable_Earth_Cut.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Earthworks for the Entire Development Site

Earthworks to raise the existing platform level of the entire development site are generally not allowed. This is to avoid creating new retaining walls.

### Earthworks within the Building Setback Area

Earthworks are generally not allowed within the road buffer/building setbacks. Any proposed earthworks shall be assessed based on site context. Where allowed, they shall not exceed 1m.

Earthworks of more than 1m to meet PUB MPL(1) shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal. Refer to earthworks in low-lying areas sub-section.

Earthworks may also be considered to:

- Create a vehicular access of maximum **4m** wide;
- Match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites.
- Create a workable platform level to mitigate level differences within an undulating or sloping site, or between the site and road.
- Facilitate building of a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback distances shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

### Earthworks within the Buildable Area

The proposed works shall be evaluated in relation to the permissible building envelope under the [Envelope Control guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC).

### Earthworks in Low-Lying Areas

For low-lying sites that need to meet PUB's Minimum Platform Level (MPL):

- Only the building structures or internal living areas and side/rear setback areas shall be raised to meet the stipulated MPL.
- The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to the required MPL. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower than the existing ground level, whichever is higher.
- Any common retaining-cum-boundary walls or fences shall be designed sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of adjacent houses or land parcels.
- The following condition shall be annotated on plans: "The Developer/Owner is fully aware that he shall raise the structures/areas built to lower platform levels, to or above the recommended Minimum Platform Level as and when the adjacent grounds/roads are raised in future and comply with any other conditions deemed necessary by PUB."

Refer to [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC) section for more information on the treatment of internal areas below the MPL.

Illustration of a Terrace House

![Illustration of a Terrace House](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/T00A_Terrace_Typology_With_Ledges.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

A terrace house is a dwelling house with its own land title(1) that forms part of a row of at least 3 dwelling houses abutting the common boundary party walls. Terrace houses can be built in designated mixed landed housing areas, if the development site area meets the minimum plot size and width requirements. At the individual plot level, a terrace house shall adhere to the applicable storey height and envelope control guidelines and building setback requirements. The permissible Gross Floor Area (GFA) for such landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and permissible building envelope under the envelope control guidelines.

There are 2 types of terrace house typology - Terrace Type I and Terrace Type II. These are differentiated by their setback requirements.

For Terrace Type I houses, the setback from the road is based on standard road buffer requirements.

For Terrace Type II houses, the required setback from the road is standardised as 2m and 1m for building wall and roof eaves respectively. Terrace II houses shall also be sited within their own enclave (refer to [Locational Criteria](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Locational-Criteria) for more information).


### Notes and Definitions

- (1): Terrace houses may also be strata-titled when approved as strata terrace houses â€“ See [Strata Landed Housing](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing) for guidelines and requirements.


## Locational Criteria

title: ```markdown
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Locational-Criteria
date: 10 March 2022
---

### Safeguarded Landed Housing Areas

An island-wide map titled [Designated Landed Housing Area Plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN) is available on URA SPACE. Terrace houses may be built within Mixed Landed Housing Areas only.

For Terrace Type II houses, these are to be located within their own enclaves.

- Within existing estates: If the site is located within an existing landed housing estate, the Terrace Type II house shall be part of an existing enclave. Alternatively, a new Terrace Type II enclave may be considered if it does not adversely impact the surrounding developments.
- For new estates: New estates, like a government sale site for landed housing developments, may provide Terrace Type II landed housing provided they are developed comprehensively as a distinct Terrace Type II estate.

### Landed Housing guided by Street Block Plans

Where there is a street block plan to guide landed housing development, the planning guidelines and requirements stipulated in the street block plan shall apply.

Conservation guidelines shall also apply for landed housing gazetted for conservation, such as in the residential historic districts of Blair Plain, Cairnhill and Emerald Hill.

### Landed Housing In Other Areas

Other sites zoned for residential use in the prevailing Master Plan may be considered for landed housing developments, depending on site context and conditions. Landed houses outside [Designated Landed Housing Areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN) and not guided by the street block plans are subject to a 3-storey height control. The prevailing landed housing planning guidelines and requirements shall also apply.



## Open Space Provision
---
title: Open Space Provision
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Open-Space-Provision
date: 5 July 2019
---

The National Parks Board (NParks) requires new landed housing development clusters of a certain total Gross Floor Area (GFA) to set aside an open space plot at a rate of 4.05sqm of open space for every 56sqm of gross floor area(1). While the minimum open space plot size required is 1,000sqm (ie a landed housing development with total gross floor area of about 13,800sqm would be required to make such provision), NParks may require a smaller open space plot based on the same computation rate depending on the adequacy of open space in the nearby area.

The open space plot shall be vested in the State before the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) issues a Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC). The open space shall be free from encumbrances, unless otherwise specified, before it can be vested in the State.

The open space provided shall be:

- Suitably located within the proposed development, such that it is conveniently accessible to the public;
- A single plot of a regular shape, and not fragmented (eg by road, drain or other reserves);
- Generally flat terrain that is neither low lying nor subject to flooding.

Where the landed housing development cluster abuts an expressway or major arterial road, part of the open space provision may double up as part of the buffer zone provided the:

- Depth of the open space plot is 3m (minimum); and
- Configuration or the open space plot is reasonably regular.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) The Open Space Provision requirements are not applicable for Strata Landed Housing developments. See Strata Landed Housing Communal Open Space and greenery provision requirements.



## Plot Size and Width

title: ```markdown
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Plot-Size-Width
date: 8 April 2024
---

The plot size and width refers to the net dimension and area of the plot excluding the land required to be set aside for vesting to the State e.g. excluding Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR).

### Terrace I

Plot Size and Width for Terrace Type I House

![Plot Size and Width for Terrace Type I House](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/TH01_Plot_Size_Width_Terrace_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Plot Size and Width Requirements for Terrace Type I Houses

| Terrace House Type    | Plot Size (Minimum) | Plot Width (Minimum) |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Type I (Intermediate) | 150sqm              | 6m                   |
| Type I (Corner)       | 200sqm              | 8m                   |

There is no site coverage control for either Terrace Type I or Type II houses.

### Terrace II

Plot Size and Width Requirements for Terrace Type II Houses

| Terrace House Type     | Plot Size (Minimum) | Plot Width (Minimum) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Type II (Intermediate) | 80sqm               | 6m                   |

There is no site coverage control for either Terrace Type I or Type II houses.

### Plot Width for Irregular Plots

For corner or intermediate terrace plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in plot width may be considered provided:

- The average width of the site remains at least 8m for a corner terrace plot, and 6m for an intermediate terrace plot, so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
- The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m;
- The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines eg setback, road buffer, etc.

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, shall be restricted to one residual plot per development (ie all other plots within the same multi-unit development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).



## RC Flat Roofs
---
title: RC Flat Roofs
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/RC-Flat-Roofs
date: 27 June 2022
---

### Introduction

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only(1). Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls(2) and the following guidelines.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agenciesâ€™ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height and may be considered beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): Height controls applicable, include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- (@): The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

- a. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
- b. The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

- a. Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas(1) shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.

- b. Elevated solar panels(2) located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:

  - Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
  - Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
  - Mixed Commercial & Residential
  - Commercial
  - Hotel
  - White
  - Residential / Institution
  - Commercial / Institution
  - Educational Institution
  - Place of Worship
  - Civic & Community Institution

- c. Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use
  - Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels

| Parameter | Guidelines                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extent    | Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level |
| Height    | Maximum 5m above roof level                                         |

![Extent and Height of Elevated Solar Panels](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA55_Solar_Panels_Landed.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).
- (2): A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.



#### Redeveloping to Other Landed Housing Forms

The illustrations apply to houses within Designated Landed Housing Areas (DLHAs). For proposals outside DLHAs, the left-behind plot must fulfil the minimum plot size requirement of 1,000 sqm.

#### Redevelopment of Existing Terrace House to Bungalow, Semi-detached and Corner Terrace

##### Allowed

![Redevelopment Allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig172_Redevelopment_A1_A.jpg?h=80%25&w=80%25)

![Redevelopment Allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig172_Redevelopment_A2_A.jpg?h=50%25&w=50%25)

The left-behind Plot D has sufficient plot size and plot width for a corner terrace house. House E may redevelop into a bungalow or a pair of semi-detached house.

Owner of House E shall be required to comply with the following conditions:

1. Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof of the remaining house as soon as the existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished;
2. Allow the owner of the adjacent house access to the subject site to maintain or repair the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining house; and
3. Submit to BCA an engineerâ€™s certification of the structural stability of the remaining house.

House E may also redevelop into an intermediate terrace and corner terrace.

##### Not Allowed

![Redevelopment Not Allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig172_Redevelopment_B_NA.jpg)

The left-behind Plot D does not have sufficient plot size and plot width for a corner terrace house. House E shall not be allowed to redevelop into a bungalow.

### Treatment of Existing Party Walls

The creation of a new blank party wall at the common boundary upon redevelopment is generally not allowed.

For all redevelopments that involve detaching from an existing unit, resulting in a bare and exposed party wall at the existing unit, the person undertaking the redevelopment shall do the following:

- Submit to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), an engineerâ€™s certification of the structural stability of the remaining unit;
- Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house as soon as the existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished; and
- Allow the adjacent owner access to the site to maintain or repair the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house. This is not required if part of the party wall within the subject site is retained.

After the adjoining unit is redeveloped, the remaining terrace unit may remain as approved.



## Retaining and Boundary Walls

Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls

![Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F14_Retaining_Wall_1m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525)

### Retaining Walls

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

- Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are impractical.
- Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate greenery effect, if fronting a road or street.

### Boundary Walls

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m high.

The combined height of retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (eg fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.

Full-height walls at the car porch/patio areas along the common boundary between terrace houses may be allowed, if:

- Site context permits (eg where the car porches are paired and aligned), or
- To meet FSSDâ€™s requirements for fire separation walls.

Full-height fire separation walls between adjacent car porches for terrace housing

![Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182b_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

In developing a site for multiple units of landed houses, the proposed developments on all the plots will need to observe the requisite road buffer from the road reserve line fronting the development boundary, even if the development site fronts two Category 5 roads. Requests for 2m side setback from any road frontage will be considered based on the merits of the proposal and the site context.

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC[) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

#### Notes and Definitions:

- (@): While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section.
- (#): The 2.4m setback applies only to the 3m (maximum) car porch width (measured column to column). Beyond this 3m, other car porch setbacks shall follow the terrace/patio setback requirements. A wider car porch may be considered on the merits of the proposal.

### Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created plots)

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones), the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch where a minimum 2.4m setback is required.

Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots

![Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD05_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg)

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an existing plot configuration and not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

#### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

![Example Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

### Rear Setback for Terrace Houses Abutting Existing Back Lanes

The 1st storey rear extension of terrace houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes. Such back lanes (with widths of between 4 to 6m) would provide adequate setback between 2 rows of houses.

Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes

![Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LH_Rear_Extensions_Abutting_Back_Lane.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

All such rear extensions shall comply with the following requirements:

- The height of the rear extension shall not exceed that of the floor-to-floor height of first storey.
- No structure or roof eave shall encroach into the back lane.
- For houses abutting state owned back lanes, new door and window openings may be allowed at the walls or boundary walls abutting the back lanes.
- For houses abutting privately owned back lanes, existing door or window openings may remain, but they shall not be enlarged or shifted. New openings or enlargement of existing openings along privately owned back lanes shall not be allowed unless the applicant has prior written consent from the back lane owner.
- Any new openings, where allowed, shall open inwards.
- A planning condition may be imposed requiring the closure of any openings along the back lane, in the event the back lane is redeveloped.

### Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf), and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf). All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg site coverage, envelope control guidelines) shall apply. Refer to the relevant street block plans for the existing estates above in the Locational Criteria section.

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

### Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

Special Control Area 1

![Link to Special Control Area 1 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

[Link to Special Control Area 2 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows(1)/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Window: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URAâ€™s evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.
