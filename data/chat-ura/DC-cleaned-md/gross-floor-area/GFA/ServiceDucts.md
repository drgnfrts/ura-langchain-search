Service ducts, including the thickness of the walls, are included as GFA once at the lowest floor, if the vertical shaft is entirely a void space.

If the service ducts are slabbed over at every floor, the service duct at each floor is included as GFA. Non-load bearing fire-stop material to compartmentalize the service ducts is excluded from GFA.
