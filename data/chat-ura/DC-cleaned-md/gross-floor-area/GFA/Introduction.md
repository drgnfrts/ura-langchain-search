For development control purpose, Singapore uses a Gross Floor Area (GFA) system to work out the bulk and intensity of a development. The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for a specific development site is defined as the ratio of the GFA of a building to its site or plot area<sup>1</span>. The allowable GPR of a development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP).

This GFA handbook explains which area or space of a development is included or excluded from GFA for development control purpose. As a general principle, all (a) covered floor area of a development, (b) uncovered area used for commercial purposes, and (c) strata area (covered or otherwise) of a development are included as GFA, unless otherwise exempted. This is regardless of whether the spaces are accessible or usable.

GFA is the total area of covered floor space, including the half thickness of external walls<sup>2</sup> or other building facade elements (e.g. windows, railings, curtain walls), but excluding voids.

### Bonus Gross Floor Area above MP Allowable Intensity

Bonus GFA is allowed over and above the MP GPR subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the GFA incentive schemes shall not be carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.

Although a site may make use of multiple GFA incentive schemes, the total GFA shall not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR. Developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

### Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

- [Residential Developments (Flats and Condominiums)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Bonus-GFA):
- Balcony Incentive Scheme
- Conserved Bungalow Scheme
- Indoor Recreation Spaces Scheme

- [Non-Residential Development (Commercial)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial/GFA-Incentive-Schemes):
- Community and Sports Facilities Scheme
- Rooftop Outdoor Refreshment Areas on Landscaped Roofs

- [Non-Residential Development (Hotel)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/GFA-Incentive-Schemes)
- Balcony Incentive Scheme
- Rooftop Outdoor Refreshment Areas on Landscaped Roofs

### Definitions

<sup>1</sup> The area of a site/plot measured between the survey boundary lines.

<sup>2</sup> For buildings with party walls, which refer to the shared wall along the common boundary of two separate developments, GFA computation will include the thickness of the party wall that is part of the building.
