**Introduction**

Warmest greetings to everyone from the team at the Singapore Pavilion.

In a few days, Expo 2020 Dubai will officially be welcoming guests and we are proud to showcase Singapore to the world through our Pavilion.

**Staying connected to the world**

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world. It has changed how we live, work and play, and connect with one another. Countries have had to adapt and learn to live with the disruptions. Our virtual meeting today exemplifies how we have adapted and managed to stay connected despite the constraints.

For Singapore, a small city-state, we are committed to being open and connected with the rest of the world and want to be a part of the global exchange of ideas and innovation.

**The Singapore Pavilion – Nature. Nurture. Future.**

Our participation in the Expo 2020 Dubai is testament to this commitment. We want to show the world what Singapore is like through our Pavilion.

Titled "Nature. Nurture. Future.", our Pavilion brings together nature and architecture, to reflect our vision of transforming Singapore into a City in Nature that is resilient, sustainable and liveable for our people. Our Pavilion will also showcase the ingenuity and creativity of Singaporeans from different backgrounds and fields.

I hope that our Pavilion will add to the conversations on how we can address urban challenges and shape a liveable future for all.

**Conclusion**

We look forward to seeing you at the Singapore Pavilion.
