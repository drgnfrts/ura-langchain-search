A very good evening. I am very happy to join all of you here at the opening of i Light Singapore 2023.   
  
This is the ninth time that URA is organising i Light Singapore, since its inaugural edition in 2010. In every edition, the Festival has delighted and inspired visitors with its exciting line-up of artworks and programmes. In fact, my family and I look forward to it every year.   
  
This year's edition promises to be as extraordinary as ever, offering fresh, immersive experiences for all to enjoy. What's more, we are thrilled to announce that for the first time, we are extending the reach of i Light Singapore by bringing artworks to South Beach and Millenia Walk, enabling more people to partake in this remarkable event.   
  
**Planning for Marina Bay and beyond**  
  
It is not by chance that we are able to enjoy such events and activities set against the beautiful backdrop of Marina Bay skyline. The Marina Bay that we love and enjoy today is a result of the meticulous planning and collective effort of many generations of city planners and stakeholders over more than 50 years.  
  
It was in 1971, a mere six years after our independence, that reclamation work began in the Bayfront area. Despite our priorities at that time being focused on urban renewal and nurturing our budding economy, our visionary pioneer leaders and planners recognised the potential and future need for our Central Business District to expand, in order to drive Singapore's competitiveness and provide opportunities for us to create a very special precinct for everyone.   
  
That vision gradually became a reality over the years as we witnessed the addition of key infrastructure, iconic buildings and large-scale events such as i Light Singapore. Today, we are reaping the fruits the fruits of that early, far sighted vision.  
  
Marina Bay stands as not only a thriving financial hub, but also an iconic destination for both Singaporeans and visitors alike - a vibrant community playground. Its distinctive skyline has become a recognisable feature of Singapore, etched in the fond memories of visitors from around the world.   
   
The planning of Marina Bay encapsulates the spirit of far-sightedness and stewardship that defines the Singaporean ethos. We thought well ahead and planned not just for ourselves, but also for our future generations.   
  
This approach will put us in good stead as we continue to plan for Singapore's future, such as through URA's upcoming Master Plan Review. We will build upon the strategies and ideas from the Long-Term Plan Review, which concluded last year, and translate them into detailed land use and developmental plans covering sites all over Singapore. We will also seek your feedback, and I hope all Singaporeans will participate actively and share your views. We look forward to your views as we want to build this country together.  
  
**Becoming stewards of the environment**  
  
Environmental sustainability has been a key theme of i Light Singapore since its inception.   
  
Through creative artworks and programmes, the Festival strives to inspire visitors to reflect on their relationship with the environment, and take steps to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.   
  
This year's edition will present a collection of 14 meaningful artworks, many of which delve into topics closely tied to environmental sustainability, such as climate change, rising sea levels and water conservation.   
  
I encourage everyone to participate in the i Light i Pledge initiative, where you can learn about eco-friendly practices and submit pledges that demonstrate your commitment to an eco-conscious lifestyle.   
  
I hope these interesting artworks and programmes will not only make for a fun night out with your family and friends, but also inspire you to embrace sustainability as part of your everyday lives.  
  
**Enlivening our city through placemaking**   
  
Events such as i Light Singapore keep Marina Bay buzzing with energy and life. This is a place where people from all walks of life can come together and connect through shared experiences.   
  
Such placemaking efforts that enliven our city are not restricted to large-scale events. URA also collaborates closely with various partners on numerous programmes and initiatives to enrich the Marina Bay visitor experience.   
  
One case in point – as you tour the i Light Singapore festival grounds, keep a look out for red lamps at Clifford Pier. These have been reinstated symbolically by The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts as a reference to the historic red lights at the pier, which served as signals in the old days to guide seafarers on where they can dock their ships. This is also the origin of the popular name for Clifford Pier – ‘Lampu Merah' in Malay and ‘Ang Teng' in Hokkien.   
  
Through this showcase, visitors can uncover more historical aspects of Marina Bay and see the place in a new light. This keeps the memory of the Bay alive, and connects the past and present generations.      
  
Beyond Marina Bay, placemaking efforts are also ongoing at many other places around Singapore. They are driven by a wide range of stakeholders, including community groups, businesses and cultural institutions, working together with support from the government agencies.   
  
I'm involved in one of them – One such example is Kampong Gelam, where the Kampong Gelam Alliance - comprising property owners, business operators as well as the cultural and religious institutions there – is working on a Place Plan that leverages placemaking initiatives to sustain and celebrate the rich heritage of the historic area. I hope to share the details of the plan with you soon.  
  
I've enjoyed myself working with all the stakeholders. I see not only as something that we all want to do for Singapore, but something we want to do together. It's something very meaningful and I'm very inspired by the commitment of the various groups of making an area like Kampong Gelam, and many other precincts in Singapore more vibrant, and I look forward to seeing more of such initiatives. We promote working together, active citizenry, and at the same time, provide platforms to build stakes for our people, businesses and our society.  
  
**Conclusion**   
  
To conclude, I would like to thank everyone who have made this event possible. i Light Singapore has become a signature and popular event among Singaporeans as well as visitors from overseas. People from all walks of life come to the Bay to see the artworks, participate in the programmes and enjoy the beautiful waterfront and skyline at each edition, and I look forward to many more editions to come.   
  
Before tonight's event, I spoke with many Singaporeans and shared with them that I would be coming to the launch today. They shared with me how they had fond memories of such an occasion. So I want to congratulate URA, all our government agencies, and all our partners for working with us, our sponsors for believing and doing this, as this is something that continues to make Singapore extraordinary.  
  
On that note, I officially declare the Festival open, and wish everyone an enjoyable evening.  
  
Thank you.
