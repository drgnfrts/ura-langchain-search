**Introduction**   
  
I want to say a big thank all of you once for joining us today. You've really added to the richness of the conversation with all your questions and comments. I should also mention that if we didn't have the opportunity to address it right now, definitely, the staff will get back to you on the specific questions that you have raised.   
  
Just coming back to the broader picture, on our public engagement journey for the past 9 months, we have envisioned the future we want together, we discussed all the strategies to get there, we went through the difficult trade-offs that need to be made.   
  
I am really heartened and encouraged by the diversity and depth of the views you have shared through your questions and answers. And what came across very clearly, is that everyone here cares deeply about Singapore, you are all very much invested in seeing our country embody all the things we value: being inclusive, resilient, sustainability, and that we must be an endearing city.   
  
**Acknowledging the Results of the Dialogue**   
  
During the dialogue today, we discussed many strategies that we have to continue to pursue to secure Singapore's future, and this includes the following. Developing the economic and commercial nodes outside the Central Business District, or polycentres, to provide more options, both for the companies as well as for workers. Planning for homes and jobs to be closer together, and for housing to be near transport nodes. We want to keep the city centre up to date, and we want to inject live work play uses there. We want more flexibility for businesses. And we also have to prepare for upcoming technologies, like autonomous vehicles and drones, and of course, sometime in the future, maybe a hyperloop. We want to make the most of the spaces we have, whether it's ground level, underground, or up in the sky.   
  
We also discussed some bold ideas that we've shared and its going to need further deliberation in view of the trade-offs involved, as well as their feasibility under present circumstances. But you never know, because with technology things can change in the future, and one day it can come true. In addition, as a small country and city, we need to balance the needs and aspirations of various segments of society.   
  
And many of you have candidly raised over the past engagements, there are difficult factors that we need to carefully consider in the course of planning for future Singapore. Examples include: Cost considerations such as construction and maintenance which differ depending on the solution proposed; Nuisance issues and dis-amenities such as noise and safety; Time and resources required for technical feasibility studies; Geological limitations that impact the feasibility of solutions, such as soil conditions; And Impact on business viability, residents' wellbeing, biodiversity and our natural heritage; As well as the conflicting aspirations which will impact our land needs differently.   
  
Once again, thank you so much for participating, sharing your frank views and contributing to this conversation.   
  
**Conclusion – Looking ahead to the Public Exhibition**   
  
Let me round up by looking ahead. Following these dialogues, URA will be launching a public exhibition on the Long-Term Plan Review sometime in the middle of this year. It will feature more details of the long-term land use strategies that has culminated from the feedback of Singaporeans. I encourage you to attend the exhibition – we are going to make it a roving exhibition that goes around the heartlands, so this way more can participate, and we make it more accessible.   
  
Meanwhile, please continue to share your views and ideas with us, and bring your friends and families into the conversation too. You can visit our LTPR webpage to find out more about our other activities or provide more feedback to us.   
  
Your ideas will shape the strategies for generations of Singaporeans to come. So let's continue to imagine and work together – towards a better future for Singapore – while also striking a balance between all our different needs, hopes, and dreams – because this little island here is full of possibilities.   
  
We look forward to partnering with you to shape our shared future together, and we look forward your views in the future. Once again, thanks everybody for joining us today, and have a great weekend!
