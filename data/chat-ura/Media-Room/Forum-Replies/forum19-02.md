BCA and URA's joint reply, 29 Aug 2019

We refer to Mr Leong Kok Seng's letter and would like to clarify the requirements and process for installing covers, such as awnings, over private enclosed spaces (PES) in condominiums (Clear guidelines needed on awnings in condos; Aug 23).

We agree that the safety of residents is paramount.

However, any home owner who plans to install a cover over a PES within his or her unit must seek the authorisation of the management corporation (MCST).

The home owner must ensure that the structures and devices they install follow the MCST's guidelines and that they do not detract from the appearance of the buildings. In some instances, the MCST can give authorisation on a case-by-case basis.

Since 2013, developers have been required to install a minimum 2m PES cover from the external wall of units, to protect residents from falling objects.

Home owners can apply to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the relevant agencies to install additional covers, after obtaining authorisation from their MCST.

URA will approve PES covers provided the structures are not excessively large and satisfy requirements on building setback and height controls, to safeguard the overall intensity of the development, while the relevant agencies will assess other aspects, such as fire safety.

**Clear guidelines needed on awnings in condos**

Another case of a condominium unit owner installing awning went before the Strata Titles Board (Strata Titles Board states its stand on condo spat over awning, Aug 19).

The root causes of such cases are the lack of clear guidelines on what can be installed and the power or expertise of the condo's management committee to deal with such matters.

In new housing developments, requests to install awnings are often made before a management committee is formed.

Hence, approval in this instance lies with the developer, whose decision may differ from that of the eventual management committee.

I suggest that the authorities make it a requirement for developers to inform potential buyers of their stand on awnings.

I am also concerned that some management committees may no longer authorise the installation of roof coverings (Residents' love-hate relationship with condo awnings, Aug 19).

Should an object fall from a higher floor and hurt the resident below, who will be held responsible?

There should be a rule that requires a management committee to approve awnings for the safety of residents in lower units.
