Come 25 December, artworks depicting acts of kindness by the community during the past year will light up the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and the Merlion at Marina Bay. In addition, another projection show reflecting hopes and aspirations for Singapore will commence from 26 December, on the facade of ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands. These projections represent **Share the Moment**, one of the key highlights of **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021_**.

Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021_** takes on a different format this year that prioritises public safety as we reflect on 2020 and welcome the coming year. To minimise the risk of crowds gathering in the precinct, there will be no fireworks display at Marina Bay on New Year's Eve.

**Share the Moment projections**

**Share the Moment** is a community project organised in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), which features a collection of student artworks projected onto the facades of three iconic Marina Bay landmarks – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, the Merlion and ArtScience Museum.

Students from various local educational institutions created the artworks inspired by stories from the , NVPC's vision of a Singapore where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to help and support others in need. **Share the Moment** will feature a total of 17 artworks by 24 students from schools including the LASALLE College of the Arts, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and Singapore Institute of Technology - The Glasgow School of Art (SIT-GSA).  
  
**Inspirations for artworks**

The students drew inspiration from efforts by organisations and individuals who helped others in need during the Covid-19 pandemic and galvanised the wider public to do the same. These included initiatives by Beng Who Cooks and Little Changemakers, amongst others.

Beng Who Cooks started as a hawker stall founded by Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long, a young Singaporean duo who prepared and distributed more than 50 free meals to Singaporeans daily during the Circuit Breaker period, despite facing challenges with their business. Inspired by their selflessness, NAFA student Livia Fin depicted the duo from Beng Who Cooks in their signature aprons distributing free meals to a queue of people in her artwork, which will be projected on the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore.

Another artwork to be projected on the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore took its inspiration from an initiative by Little Changemakers –  – that called on children to cheer on frontline heroes through folding origami hearts as tokens of appreciation. The illustration by NYP student Lau En Qi portrays a collage of origami creations that represent messages of love and encouragement for frontline heroes. The artwork highlights how even small acts of kindness from children can make a difference in our society.

Over at the Merlion, one of the artworks to be featured was inspired by stories of people sewing handmade masks for the vulnerable community. SIT-GSA students Doreen Goh and Nurul Alisyah used the motif of sewing to convey how a thread binds communities together, symbolising the help and support offered to one another during difficult times. The mane of the Merlion in the artwork was designed to simulate mask fabric, whilst its body is patterned with dotted lines to mimic stitches made in sewn fabric.

Also, as part of **Share the Moment**, the facade of ArtScience Museum will be lit with hopes and aspirations for Singapore. One of the artworks to be featured is LASALLE student Amanda Teo's hope for Singapore to continue to be adaptive in today's ever-changing world.
