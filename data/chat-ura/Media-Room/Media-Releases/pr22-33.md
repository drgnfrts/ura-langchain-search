This year-end, crowd-favourite fireworks will return to illuminate the Marina Bay skyline as part of Singapore's biggest countdown event, **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2023_**.

Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2023_** will bring back the highly anticipated fireworks display after a two-year absence due to safety measures necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Come 31 December, members of the public will be able to view the fireworks at midnight from around the Bay to welcome the new year.

With the theme "City of Good", **_Share the Moment_** will feature never-before-seen original artworks by students from local educational institutions, which celebrate acts of giving both big and small, and depict a vision of Singapore where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others.    
  
At the Bayfront Event Space, The Show Master, a premium entertainment arm by Uncle Ringo, will present **_The Great Bay Fiesta_** from 1 December, comprising three highlights. The entertainment show,  will feature over 30 food stalls with unique and exclusive offerings.
