On behalf of the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has launched a site at Gibraltar Crescent for sale by public tender, to pilot a new residential care community concept for persons with dementia. The dementia care village is part of ongoing efforts to improve the quality of life of persons with dementia and broaden the care and residential options available to them.

**Pilot of Dementia Care Village**

The dementia care village will be specially designed to provide a safe, home-like environment where residents are assisted to live independently. It will provide tailored services and programmes to create meaningful participation and social interactions among its residents.

Through collaboration with nearby community partners, the village is also expected to provide better access to supporting services and amenities in the wider community for persons with dementia and their families.

As a new residential option catering to individuals with varying stages of dementia, this pilot complements the home-based care and dementia day care services available today. We hope that the pilot will offer insights into market demand for such facilities and the community needs of persons with dementia, which will contribute to the development of suitable dementia care models in the future.

**Site Attributes**

Located near Sembawang Park, the site comprises a cluster of 10 State bungalows. The site's location and layout will provide a conducive environment for persons with dementia. The pilot dementia care village could also present opportunities for the successful tenderer and community partners to collaborate on active ageing programmes and provide other eldercare services for residents. The lease will be for 30 years.

Details of the land parcel are in [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Jul/pr19-31a.pdf) and the location plan in [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Jul/pr19-31b.pdf).

**Details of Tender**

A Concept & Price Revenue tender will be adopted to evaluate the tenders received for the sale site at Gibraltar Crescent to ensure that the selected concept proposal aligns with the vision of the dementia care village.

Under this system, tenderers are required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately. The concept proposals will be first evaluated against a set of criteria specified in the tender. The criteria include an assessment of the suitability of the proposed overall model of care for persons with dementia, as well as the quality of the care programmes and services. Only concept proposals that are shortlisted will proceed to the second stage for evaluation, which will be based on price only. The site will then be awarded to the tenderer with the highest bid price among those with acceptable concept proposals.

The tender will close at 12 noon on 19 November 2019.
