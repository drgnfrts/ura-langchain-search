On behalf of the Ministry of Health, the Urban Redevelopment Authority announced today that no award was made for the site at Gibraltar Crescent.

The site at Gibraltar Crescent was launched for sale via the Concept and Price Revenue Tender1 approach on 16 July 2019 to pilot a new residential care community concept for individuals with varying stages of dementia. One of the objectives of the tender was to seek ideas from the private sector to develop new care options for persons with dementia to facilitate ageing-in-place.

The tender closed on 15 January 2020. One tender submission was received from Pre 11 Pte. Ltd. and Orpea Singapore Pte. Ltd.

The tender has been rejected as the sole price bid of $15,000,000 (details of the price bid are shown in [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2020/May/pr20-18b.pdf) ) offered by Pre 11 Pte. Ltd. and Orpea Singapore Pte. Ltd. was deemed too low.

The Government will continue to review the range of options available for seniors to age-in-place in the community as well as the viability of a dedicated residential care option for individuals with dementia. We will continue to consult public and private sector stakeholders.



1 Under the Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach, the concept proposals would first be evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee against a set of criteria, which included suitability of the proposed model of care for persons with dementia, as well as the quality of the care programmes and services (see details in [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2020/May/pr20-18a.pdf) ). Acceptable concept proposals would proceed to the second stage of the tender evaluation, where the price envelopes of acceptable concept proposals would then be opened and evaluated based on price.
