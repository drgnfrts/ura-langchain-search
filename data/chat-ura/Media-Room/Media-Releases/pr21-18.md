The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released two residential with commercial at 1st storey sites at Slim Barracks Rise (Parcels A & B) for sale today under the Confirmed List of the first half 2021 (1H2021) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.

The land parcels are launched for sale as part of JTC Corporation (JTC)'s continued efforts to inject more residential spaces in the one-north estate to meet housing needs and enhance the area as a vibrant mixed use business park that serves as a fertile ground for research, innovation and entrepreneurship. Together, these two land parcels can potentially yield a total of about 405 residential units.
