The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released the flash estimate of the price index for private residential property for 4th Quarter 2021 today.  
  
Overall, the private residential property index increased by 8.3 points from 165.3 points in 3rd Quarter 2021 to 173.6 points in 4th Quarter 2021. This represents an increase of 5.0%, compared to the 1.1% increase in the previous quarter (see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2022/Jan/pr22-01a.pdf) ). For the whole of 2021, prices increased by 10.6%, compared to the 2.2% increase in 2020.  
  
Prices of non-landed private residential properties in the Core Central Region (CCR) increased by 2.5%, compared to the 0.5% decrease in the previous quarter. Prices in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) increased by 7.3%, compared to the 2.6% increase in the previous quarter. Prices in Outside Central Region (OCR) increased by 5.4%, compared to the 0.1% decrease in the previous quarter (see [Annex C](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2022/Jan/pr22-01c.pdf) ). For the whole of 2021, prices in CCR, RCR, OCR increased by 3.7%, 16.9% and 8.4% respectively.  
  
The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment and data on units sold by developers up till mid-December, prior to the implementation of the latest round of property market cooling measures on 16 December 2021. The statistics will be updated on 28 January 2022 when URA releases its full set of real estate statistics for 4th Quarter 2021. Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution.
