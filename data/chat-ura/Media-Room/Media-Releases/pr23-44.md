Fireworks illuminated the skyline with exuberant colours to ring in 2023 at the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown last year.

Come December, prepare to be dazzled and thrilled as we usher in the new year at Singapore's largest countdown celebration, the **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024_**. Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), this year's countdown promises an unforgettable experience for revellers of all ages and backgrounds, with a breathtaking fireworks show, inspiring light projections, exhilarating attractions such as a go-kart arena and winter playground as well as exciting live performances.

This year, the highly-anticipated New Year Eve's fireworks will be launched from a more central location of the Bay, offering more spectators a captivating viewing experience from all around. Produced by the team behind , the fireworks musical that mesmerised the crowd last year, these fireworks will light up the Bay across three chapters, unfolding at intervals in the hour leading up to midnight.  
  
Choreographed to tell a story of reflection and hope, the fireworks will kick off with a tribute to the past year's challenges and triumphs, before heralding the promise of new beginnings and thereafter, culminating in a 12-minute grand finale celebrating Singaporeans' unyielding spirit as we embrace the future. The audience can look forward to an immersive experience with artisanal fireworks that change colour as they burst and bloom into rings of different colours, accompanied by specially curated music played through speakers around the Bay.
