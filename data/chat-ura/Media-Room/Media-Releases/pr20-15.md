The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has collaborated with retail mall operators to launch a new website that provides the public with regular updates on the crowd levels in malls across Singapore. Named  ([www.spaceout.gov.sg](https://www.spaceout.gov.sg)), the website allows the public to find out which malls are less crowded during different times of the day, before they head out to buy essential goods and services.

This helps the public make informed choices on where and when to make their essential purchases and maintain safe distancing, as they are less likely to visit malls that are very crowded or those that have reached maximum operating capacity.

When there is a more even spread of shoppers across different malls, it will not only be easier for shoppers to practise safe distancing, but also ease the pressure on retail mall operators in terms of crowd management.

Please refer to the [Annex](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2020/Apr/pr20-15a.pdf)  for the list of participating malls.

How the website works

Each mall is represented on the map by a coloured circle – green (not crowded), yellow (some crowd), orange (crowded), and red (max). The website will also show malls with no crowd level information available in grey.

The crowd levels are derived based on the data from retail malls on shopper traffic and the safe distancing guidelines for retail malls by Enterprise Singapore (ESG).

URA will continue to invite more mall operators to join this initiative and progressively provide information on crowd levels for more malls on the website.
