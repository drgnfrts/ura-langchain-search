**i Light Singapore (iLSG)** returns for its 10th edition from 31 May to 23 June 2024 to light up Marina Bay and neighbouring precincts. Organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the footprint of Asia's leading sustainable light festival has expanded further in this milestone edition. Beyond Marina Bay, South Beach and Millenia Walk, iLSG will also be arriving in Tanjong Pagar for the first time.

The engaging line-up of artworks and programmes for iLSG 2024 is the result of continued collaboration with many partners – event organisers, sponsors and precinct stakeholders – and will feature 17 artworks by 25 artists. This year's Festival is inspired by the theme of  and the colour green, a wavelength on the visible light spectrum1 that symbolises nature and our environment. Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in contemplative and interactive artworks that explore the endless potential of everyday objects for re-design, restoration and repurposing.   
  
"Since its inception in 2010, visitorship to i Light Singapore has grown from over 400,000 to almost 2 million in recent years. The over 200 eclectic light art installations and exciting programmes presented to date would not have been possible without the partnership with our community stakeholders and sponsors. Their strong support has enabled the Festival to not only blossom into a signature showcase that transforms Marina Bay into a vibrant destination for visitors from all walks of life, but also provides a platform to foster greater public awareness on environmental issues and promote cultural exchange amongst artists from around the world. This edition marks another milestone as we have onboarded more partners who share our passion for art and sustainability. We look forward to inspiring more visitors to shape a sustainable future for all through i Light." said **Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA.**   
  
**Delve into the beauty and wonder of **   
  
At the main festival grounds at Marina Bay, visitors can explore an immersive world of light art installations that offer unique perspectives on pertinent environmental issues.   
  
At the Mist Walk, **_Spin Me a Yarn_** by United Kingdom-based Studio Vertigo will feature larger-than-life yarn balls that are intertwined with its surroundings, signalling how yarn preparation by the fashion industry contributes significantly to global pollution. The artwork reminds us of the need to reverse unsustainable practices that underpin modern lifestyles. Another creative take on the theme of circularities is **_Kinetic Perspective_** by Spain-based Juan Fuentes Studio, located at the Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza. Made out of upcycled iron remnants from industrial sources and inspired by optical illusions, the circles in the installation move continuously to create infinite combinations, transforming the familiar into something extraordinary.

Near the Red Dot Design Museum, **_Liminal;Minimal_** by Singapore University of Technology and Design students Benjamin Lim and Yeo Soon Yii will be installed using repurposed materials from building sites and spotlights the issue of construction waste. Juxtaposed against the cityscape along the Marina Bay waterfront promenade, it serves as a reminder for more sustainable practices in the face of rapid urban development.

At the DTP Community Green, visitors can delight in **_Kickit Team Tennis_**, an interactive light installation by Hungary-based artist collective Limelight. Two teams of up to five-a-side can put their agility to test in a game reminiscent of tennis, where players on two ends kick the illuminated balls and send delightful light paths across a field. Over at Tras Link Park, **_Hidden Garden_** by Koros Design will feature trees dressed up with light art inflatables that resemble different flower species, as a tribute to the beautiful flora and fauna in our city.

At the Fountain Plaza, visitors will be invited to sit on illuminated yoga balls wrapped in upcycled net fabric where they can move them around and play, rest and interact with others. South Beach will also feature **_The Lantern_** by Josephine Pun Tsz Kiu from the National University of Singapore, a luminous pavilion ingeniously upcycled from over 5,000 plastic bottles, symbolising renewal while serving as a sobering reminder of the waste we generate.
