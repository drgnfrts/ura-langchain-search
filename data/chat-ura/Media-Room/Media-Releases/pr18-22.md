URA will be launching a public consultation exercise on a proposed regulatory framework for the use of private residential properties as short-term accommodation .   
  
In 2015, URA conducted a public consultation exercise to better understand the public's views on using private residential properties for short-term accommodation. Following a review of the feedback received, URA has worked with relevant agencies to develop a framework to regulate the use of private residential properties for short-term accommodation.   
  
The proposed framework includes qualifying criteria for homes to be used as short-term accommodation; requirements and conditions which homeowners who use their properties for short-term accommodation must comply with; and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders such as Management Corporations (MCSTs) and short-term accommodation platforms in ensuring that these activities are conducted in accordance with the proposed rules.  
  
URA welcomes members of the public to review the consultation document and share their views on the proposed framework at the following webpage: https://ura.sg/sta.  Members of the public can also share their views on the REACH Portal. The closing date for submission is 31 May 2018.

1 Short-term accommodation refers to the rental of private residential properties for periods of less than three consecutive months.
