Cyclists, joggers and families can look forward to a special edition of Car-Free Sunday SG at one-north, a vibrant work-live-play-learn estate masterplanned and developed by JTC, on 29 April 2018 from 9am to 12noon. It will be the first time the popular event will be held outside the Civic District.  
  
Car-Free Sunday SG @ one-north, jointly organised by JTC and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), is in line with JTC's efforts to promote a car-lite environment in one-north. On Sunday morning, roads will be partially or fully closed to create a large area for cycling, jogging and walking, along with a myriad of exciting activities for everyone throughout the 200ha estate.  
  
More details on the special edition will be announced closer to the event.
