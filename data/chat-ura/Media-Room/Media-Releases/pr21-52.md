Come 26 December, the facades of three iconic Marina Bay landmarks will come aglow with vibrant projection shows celebrating the spirit of giving to the community. Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in support of the **_Singapore Together_**1 movement,  is one of the key highlights of Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2022. A visual storytelling showcase featuring 15 artworks by local students, the projection shows will depict heartwarming stories of the year past, and inspire hope and optimism as we welcome the year ahead as one Singapore.   
  
**Sharing inspirational stories through intricate projection artworks**  
  
**_Share the Moment_** is a community project organised for the second year running in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), in support of its vision for a City of Good2. This year, student artists from nine local educational institutions3  took inspiration from stories of the President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards (PVPA)4  2021 nominees – a diverse range of individuals, leaders and organisations recognised for their acts of giving to the community.   
  
Through personal conversations with some of these award nominees, the students translated the nominees' inspirational stories into creative and intricate artworks, which will be projected onto the facades of three iconic landmarks at Marina Bay as vivid light projection shows. The shows will illustrate stories of how Singaporeans of all backgrounds have worked together in the past year to strive towards the vision of a caring and equal society, and aim to rally the community together through an uplifting visual experience.  
  
**Drawing inspiration from stories of the community**  
  
One such artwork to be projected onto the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is by Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) student How Hee Lin. It represents the spirit of positivity, love and kindness displayed by all PVPA nominees. The many pairs of hands depict how individuals have lent a helping hand towards various causes, and remind viewers of the little blessings received in 2021 as they look forward to 2022.

Another artwork to be projected onto the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore took inspiration from the Migrant Workers Vision Care programme, a partnership between  and Migrant Workers' Centre. Since 2020, the programme has provided 300,000 migrant workers with free reading glasses, vision screenings and eye care education. Inspired by the work of the Migrant Workers Vision Care programme, Shannen Sutanto of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) illustrated a cheerful and uplifting portrait of migrant workers in Singapore that depicts their stories of friendship, love and sacrifice.

The Merlion will also take on colourful hues of eye-catching artworks projections. One of them is by Temasek Polytechnic student Nur Qistina Bte Soherdy, who was inspired by the stories of cleaning and antimicrobial technology company Speco Singapore and the Pan Pacific Hotels Group. The two organisations share a common goal of uplifting marginalised communities – Speco has partnered more than 90 social service agencies to train, upskill and employ over 300 individuals; while Pan Pacific Hotels Group runs a central kitchen programme with a social enterprise and charity partners to enable employment for persons with disabilities. Nur Qistina's artwork pays tribute to the spirit of inclusivity and empowerment, and depicts people from different walks of life coming together to do their part for Singapore.

Over at the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands, NAFA student Elsa Tania's artwork features another meaningful social initiative –  by David Hoe, a youth empowerment programme which creates opportunities for disadvantaged students to discover their talents in non-academic pathways. Her artwork depicts how pursuits such as songwriting, photography and fashion have helped students ignite their inner spark, making their world more colourful and fulfilling.
