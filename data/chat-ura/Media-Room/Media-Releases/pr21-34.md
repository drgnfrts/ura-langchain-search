From a mesmerising light display inspired by our connection with nature, to thought-provoking conversations on sustainable and liveable cities of the future interspersed with films that present Singapore through its people, heritage and stories, the Singapore Pavilion is ready to welcome the world at Expo 2020 Dubai when it opens to the public from 1 October 2021.

Visitors will go on an experiential journey through the lushly-landscaped spaces that epitomise Singapore's vision of becoming a , which will come alive with a line-up of multimedia exhibits and engaging programmes that people from all walks of life can enjoy.

Mr. Larry Ng, Commissioner-General of the Singapore Pavilion, explains, "The realisation of the Singapore Pavilion is important for Singapore, as it provides us with the platform to connect with people from around the world and engage in important future-shaping conversations. As visitors experience the Pavilion through its welcoming spaces, digital exhibits and programmes, we hope that they will gain new perspectives on how nature and technology can be integrated into our urban spaces, and see the possibilities of how our cities can be designed to be sustainable, liveable and resilient."

Elaborating further, Ng shared, "Singapore, as a global hub, will continue to remain connected with the world. The Pavilion signals our readiness to lead and participate in conversations, as well as to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and ideas between our people, innovators and businesses. We look forward to welcoming the world into our Pavilion, and igniting ideas through greater collaborations between our nations to overcome the global challenges of today."

**A multi-faceted exploration of Singapore's sustainability journey**

Echoing the theme of "Nature. Nurture. Future.", the Singapore Pavilion is an architectural feat – a green, living, self-sufficient ecosystem that embodies the nation's journey towards growth, sustainability and resilience while confronting some of the most complex and challenging urban realities of our time.

Beyond the green architecture of the Pavilion, this guiding ethos of sustainable development is also distilled into multimedia showcases. At the City Cone, visitors will be taken on an immersive voyage, in a commissioned cinematic experience by leading Singaporean creative Brian Gothong Tan. Mapped onto the interior sloping wall of the City Cone, the panoramic film layers animated matte paintings, drone footage and hundreds of videos to depict environmental challenges faced by global urbanisation, and the innovative urban solutions Singapore has realised to create a city where the built environment co-exists in harmony with nature.

Designed by Singapore lighting design practice Light Collab, the nightly  light show is a spectacle of luminosity, shadows and sound that reflects Singapore as a green and sustainable city.
