The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has launched a commercial and residential site at Jalan Anak Bukit for sale by public tender today under the Confirmed List of the first half 2020 (1H2020) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme. This site, which is located within the Beauty World precinct, can potentially yield about 845 residential units. Details of the land parcel can be found in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2020/Jun/pr20-21a.pdf) .

**Concept and Price Revenue Tender Approach**

Located within one of Singapore's endearing identity nodes, the Beauty World precinct is envisioned to be a green urban village that will be a centre of community life and southern gateway into Bukit Timah's nature attractions. With the completion of the Coast-to-Coast trail, upcoming completion of the Rail Corridor and Rifle Range Nature Park, as well as the new public and private development projects1 in the area, the sale of this site for a mixed-use integrated transport hub will further spur the rejuvenation of Beauty World, inject vibrancy into the area and enhance the overall commuting experience with convenient connection between the Downtown Line and bus services.

The vision is for the 3.22 ha site to be a distinctive development and identity marker for the Beauty World precinct when completed. It is envisaged to offer a lushly landscaped and attractive living environment that is well connected to the surrounding nature attractions. It should include thoughtfully-designed public spaces and pedestrian networks that are well integrated with transport and community uses.

In line with the vision, a Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach is adopted to shortlist quality development concepts that are attractive and respond well to the surrounding context, with meaningful integration of amenities connected through a seamless network of pedestrian-friendly streets and well-designed public spaces.

Under the Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach, tenderers are required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately. The concept proposals will first be evaluated against a set of criteria specified in the tender (see [Annex 3](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2020/Jun/pr20-21c.pdf)  on evaluation criteria for the site). Only compelling concept proposals will be shortlisted to proceed to the second stage of evaluation, which will be based on price only. Tenderers are encouraged to propose quality concepts that are closely aligned with the planning vision for the site, while submitting a competitively priced bid.

**Other Details**

We will offer a longer tender period of nine months for developers to make their assessment and prepare the tender submission in view of the on-going COVID-19 situation. Tender for this site will close at 12 noon on 30 March 2021.
