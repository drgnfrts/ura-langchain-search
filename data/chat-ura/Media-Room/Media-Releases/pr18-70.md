Latest urban logistics innovations showcased as solutions to changing needs

Published: 04 December 2018

In anticipation of the challenges increasingly faced by the urban logistics sector, the latest Urban Lab exhibition brings together an overview of innovations being explored and piloted in Singapore.

Rapid changes in the retail landscape and the way people buy and consume goods, such as the rise of e-commerce, are presenting new challenges for businesses and delivery companies. ‘Delivering Together: Transforming Urban Logistics' is a timely showcase of promising solutions that address the complexities of the urban logistics system and provide benefits to businesses, consumers and the city as a whole.

Through a comprehensive look at creative efforts across the industry to optimise deliveries, the exhibition aims to present a holistic and integrated vision of how the urban logistics system can be transformed in Singapore, and how stakeholders can be involved.

This seventh instalment of the Urban Lab exhibition series was launched today by Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong. Broadly, it examines the following aspects:

- i. The importance of urban logistics in supporting the functions of the city and the need to optimise urban logistics for the efficiency, liveability and sustainability of the city.
- ii. New modes of collaboration and technological advances that are driving the industry forward, both in Singapore and overseas.
- iii. How the urban logistics system can be transformed through new alternative delivery modes, and different stakeholders working together to achieve system-wide benefits.

Chief Executive Officer of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Lim Eng Hwee said: "With trends like e-commerce, the volume of deliveries is increasing and this can lead to congestion. Given our limited road space, innovations in urban logistics complement our land use and transport strategies to ensure our city remains highly liveable, even as goods are efficiently delivered. URA will continue to work with other agencies and industry stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of these ideas."

'Delivering Together: Transforming Urban Logistics' will be exhibited at The URA Centre atrium from 4 December 2018 to 25 January 2019.
