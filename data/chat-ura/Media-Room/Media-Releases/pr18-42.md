The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize 2018 Laureate Seoul, is recognised as the role model for megacities with a will to change. Its successive leaders and city government devised innovative solutions, which turned it around from a bureaucratic top-down city with rising tensions between the government and its people, into an inclusive, socially stable and dynamic city. Seoul has implemented successful and impactful projects to repurpose urban infrastructure, and proven itself as an excellent example of how visionary leadership, commitment to citizen engagement, decisive data-driven moves and creativity, can transform the environment, boost vibrancy and improve the quality of life for its people. Mayor of Seoul, Mr Park Won-soon received the Prize on behalf of the city.

The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize 2018 Laureate, Professor Rita R. Colwell is recognised for her pioneering insights into microbial water quality surveillance, and her pivotal contributions in translating these insights into concrete practices and policies to better manage waterborne diseases and protect public health. A world-renowned scientist, Professor Colwell's discoveries and innovations have changed the way the world thinks of water microbiology. Her seminal work has significantly contributed to the understanding and prevention of waterborne diseases, helping to improve water safety, and protect the health and lives of millions of people worldwide.

The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize and the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize are some of the key highlights of the World Cities Summit and Singapore International Water Week, which are co-located with CleanEnviro Summit Singapore. All three events are being held at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore until 12 July 2018.
