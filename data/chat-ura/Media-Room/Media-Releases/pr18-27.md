Tenderers for the subject site at Hillview Rise were required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices in two separate envelopes.   
  
The concept proposals will be first evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee chaired by the Building and Construction Authority. Concept proposals that demonstrate comparable or higher construction productivity outcomes based on the evaluation criteria specified in the tender conditions for the site will be shortlisted (see [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2018/May/pr18-27b.pdf) ). Only tenders that meet the evaluation criteria will be considered for award.   
  
At the second stage, the price envelopes of the proposals with acceptable concepts will be opened for consideration. The site will then be awarded to the tenderer with the highest bid price among those with acceptable concept proposals.  
  
This is not an announcement of tender award. A decision on the award of the tender will be made after the tenders have been evaluated. This will be published at a later date.
