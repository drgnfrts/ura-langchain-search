With the end of the year fast approaching, Singapore's iconic Marina Bay precinct is getting ready to welcome 2023 with a series of highly-anticipated programmes and activities, including spectacular light projections created by students from local educational institutions, and the long-awaited return of the countdown fireworks — the first since the COVID-19 pandemic. From foodies to music enthusiasts; from families in search of free activities to thrill-seekers, there's something for everyone this year. Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2023_** invites everyone to usher in the new year together.  
  
**Light projection shows to usher in the new year with hope and gratitude**   
  
In partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and Giving.sg, **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2023_** will present **_Share the Moment_**, a series of light projection shows on the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and the Merlion, from 26 to 31 December. This year's theme titled "City of Good" features 14 never-before-seen original creations by students from 6 local educational institutions. As we welcome a new year with renewed hope, the light projections aim to celebrate acts of giving both big and small, and inspire everyone to continue giving their best for others and communities in need.    
  
The students took inspiration from stories of the President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards (PVPA)1 2022 nominees – a diverse range of individuals, leaders and organisations recognised for their acts of giving to the community – to create their artworks.   
  
One such artwork, which will be projected on the façade of the Merlion, took inspiration from community initiatives by food services company Sodexo and North Division Girl Guides' partnership with Sree Narayana Mission (Singapore), and captures Singapore's  spirit in HDB flats by depicting volunteers giving out food packs to low-income families, and a Girl Guide helping an elderly woman.

Another meaningful artwork is inspired by the National Library Board and how it promotes reading and learning. It pays tribute to public libraries by depicting the abundance of learning resources, and how they provide all of us with access to knowledge for personal growth and development.

Over at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, a myriad of kaleidoscopic colours similarly await. One such artwork is inspired by DBS's Adopt-A-Hawker Centre initiative, which supported the livelihoods of hawkers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It depicts the spread of love through food, and highlights the diversity of Singapore's hawker culture through the use of vibrant colours.

Another poignant artwork took inspiration from Grant Pereira, a passionate environmental advocate, as well as the Children's Cancer Foundation, a social service agency that provides children with cancer and their families with much needed support. In this piece, the artist combines both sources of inspiration by illustrating children with flowers for hair, flourishing in a beautiful garden like the ones that Grant Pereira has dedicated his time to cultivating.

**Light installations at the Marina Bay waterfront promenade**

Presented in collaboration with local philanthropic organisation The Majurity Trust, **_Brightening Lives 2023_** features light installations such as fairy light tunnels and trees festooned with meteor drip lights that are perfect for Instagram shots. These light installations aim to add festive cheer to the Bay, and also signify our collective commitment to offer time and resources to better the lives of people around us who are in need.
