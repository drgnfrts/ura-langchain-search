The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has launched two residential sites at Mattar Road and Silat Avenue for sale by public tender today under the Confirmed List of the first half 2018 Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme. Together, these two sites can potentially yield about 1,375 residential units. Details of the land parcels can be found in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2018/Mar/pr18-13a.pdf) and the location plans are in [Annex 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2018/Mar/pr18-13b.pdf).  
  
**Future development at Silat Avenue to be sensitively integrated with the Rail Corridor**  
  
The land parcel is located at Silat Avenue, between the existing Silat neighbourhood and a section of the Rail Corridor across Kampong Bahru Road. The 24km-long Rail Corridor will in future become an inclusive community space and seamless leisure corridor, where greenery and Singapore's railway heritage are hallmarks of its experience. Spanning north to south of the island through several housing estates, workplaces, schools, and recreational nodes such as parks, the Round Island Route and Coast to Coast Trail, there is also potential to sensitively integrate the Rail Corridor with existing and future developments, and create a distinctive environment for these communities.   
  
The future development is envisioned to inject new vibrancy into the neighbourhood, and provide a differentiated living environment where high-rise living is assimilated with greenery and heritage. It will be sensitively and innovatively integrated with the Rail Corridor, as well as five blocks of conserved Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) flats. There will also be new green spaces, and residents will have direct access to the Rail Corridor, where the former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, a future multi-functional community node and key gateway into the Corridor, is less than 2 km away.  
  
**Other Details**  
  
The tender for the two sites will close at 12 noon on 26 April 2018. The tender closing for these two sites will be batched with another residential site at Cuscaden Road which was launched for sale on 27 February 2018.
