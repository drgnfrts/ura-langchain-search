The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) closed the tender for the Government Land Sales sites at Media Circle and Marina Gardens Crescent on 18 January 2024.   
  
The tender for the site at Media Circle has been awarded to the highest tenderer, CNQC Realty (Clementi) Pte. Ltd. and Forsea Residence Pte. Ltd.   
  
The tender for the site at Marina Gardens Crescent has not been awarded, as the sole bid submitted by GuocoLand (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., Intrepid Investments Pte. Ltd. and TID Residential Pte. Ltd. is assessed to be too low (see details of the tenders for the sites in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2024/Feb/pr24-05a.pdf) ). The site will now be made available on the Reserve List of the first half 2024 Government Land Sales Programme, to allow interested tenderers to submit applications for the sale of the site with a minimum price that is acceptable to the government.   
  
Details on the Marina Gardens Crescent site can be found in [Annex 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2024/Feb/pr24-05b_v2.pdf)  and more information is available on the URA website at [https://www.ura.gov.sg/sitesforapplication](https://www.ura.gov.sg/sitesforapplication)
