The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released the flash estimate of the price index for private residential property for 4th Quarter 2018 today.

Overall, the private residential property index decreased by 0.1 point from 149.7 points in 3rd Quarter 2018 to 149.6 points in 4th Quarter 2018. This represents a decrease of 0.1%, compared to the 0.5% increase in the previous quarter (see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Jan/pr19-01a.pdf)  and [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Jan/pr19-01b.pdf)). For the whole of 2018, prices have increased by 7.9%, compared with the 1.1% increase in 2017.

Prices of non-landed private residential properties decreased by 1.5% in Core Central Region (CCR), compared to the 1.3% increase in the previous quarter. Prices in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) increased by 1.8%, after registering a decrease of 1.3% in the previous quarter. Prices in Outside Central Region (OCR) increased by 0.8%, after registering a 0.1% decrease in the previous quarter (see [Annex C](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Jan/pr19-01c.pdf) ). For the whole of 2018, prices in CCR, RCR and OCR have increased by 6.2%, 7.4% and 9.5% respectively.

The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment and data on units sold by developers up till mid-December. The statistics will be updated on 25 January 2019 when URA releases its full set of real estate statistics for 4th Quarter 2018. Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution.
