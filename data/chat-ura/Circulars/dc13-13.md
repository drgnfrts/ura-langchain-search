Who Should Know:  
Architects, lighting designers, building owners and developers

  

Effective Date:  
With effect from 20 November 2013

  

**Details**

1.  The Civic District Lighting Plan Guidebook was published in 1995 and has successfully guided the lighting up of developments within the Civic District. Today, most of the buildings in the Civic District are lit, contributing to the grandeur and dignity of the Civic District.

2.  The Night Lighting Masterplan for Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) was subsequently published in 2010 to guide the lighting up of selected buildings within the BBB arts and heritage district.

3.  In response to feedback from architects, developers and lighting designers, URA has reviewed the guidelines to ensure that they remain relevant and user-friendly. The two sets of the guidelines will be streamlined to better reflect the synergy and close proximity of the two areas, which share a rich multi- cultural heritage and architectural diversity.

4.  The key revisions to the guidelines are summarised as follows:
    1.  To simplify the building classifications into 2 categories for both BBB and Civic District;
    2.  To use "Lux" instead of "Candela" as a measure of lighting intensity for BBB to make it easier for developers, lighting designers and building owners to submit their lighting applications without the need for sophisticated lighting simulation software; and
    3.  To provide a wider range of colour temperature and lighting intensity for Civic District to give more flexibility for the proposed lighting designs, and to be consistent with those within BBB.
