**This Circular supersedes Part B of the Circular: URA/PB/2004/29-CUDD dated 6 Sep 2004 on "Guidelines to encourage more innovative and better design of rooftops".**

1.  URA has undertaken a review of the existing screening guidelines for Mechanical and Electrical Services and Car Parks. The review incorporated feedback from the industry and took into account, built examples.  
      
    
2.  The revised guidelines aim to promote the effectiveness of the screening while ensuring that the ventilation requirements for the proper functioning of Mechanical and Electrical equipment and fire safety requirements are not compromised. The guidelines are intended to provide clarity on what would be considered effective screening. Alternative proposals that achieve effective screening will be considered.  
      
**Areas where guidelines will apply**
    
3.  The screening guidelines will be applicable to all new erections, reconstruction works, major A&A works, cladding and roofing works within the Central Area, Urban Design Areas1 outside of the Central Area, as well as government land sale sites and strategic redevelopment sites. See detailed guidelines in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Mar/dc22-01_Annex-1.pdf) and built examples in [Annex 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Mar/dc22-01_Annex-2.pdf).
