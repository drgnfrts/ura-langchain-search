CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

Who Should Know:  
Building owners, architects, engineers, contractors and solar photovoltaic (PV) suppliers/system integrators

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

1.  URA has published planning guidelines for the installation of solar panels in developments to provide greater clarity to the industry and support the national drive towards environmental sustainability.

2.  Generally, the installation of solar panels in a development does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described in the following section. In addition, the installation of M&E equipment for the solar panel system such as inverters also does not require planning permission.

**When planning permission is required for solar panels**1

3.  In developments within areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas, the installation of solar panels will require prior planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.

4.  For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors2.

**Elevated solar panels located in specific zones**

5.  Elevated solar panels that are located in the following land use zones will require planning permission:

<table width="100%" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul style="margin-bottom:0px;"><li>Residential</li><li>Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey</li><li>Commercial &amp; Residential</li><li>Commercial</li><li>Hotel</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul style="margin-bottom:0px;"><li>White</li><li>Residential / Institution</li><li>Commercial / Institution</li><li>Educational Institution</li><li>Place of Worship</li><li>Civic &amp; Community Institution</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

6.  A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than:

    2.  1m from the roof level for landed housing developments \[in view of the low-rise character of landed houses\], or
    3.  1.8m from the roof level for other developments

7.  The space under elevated or non-elevated solar panels will not be counted as GFA unless it is enclosed or put to commercial uses such as outdoor refreshment area. Planning permission will be required for such instances.

8.  Elevated solar panels that require planning permission will generally be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

<table style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2; width: 20%;"><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td style="width: 80%;"><strong>Guidelines (refer to <a></a><a href="/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-10/dc19-10-App1.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 1</a> for illustration)</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Extent</strong></td><td>Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"><strong>Height</strong></td><td>Maximum 5m from roof level (for non-landed developments)<br><br>Or<br><br>Maximum 1m above roof level (for landed housing)</td></tr></tbody></table>

9.  URA will take into consideration the context of a proposal e.g. limited roof space for installation of solar panels in applying the guidelines stated in paragraph 8.

10. The installation of solar panels should not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme3.

11. This circular should be read in conjunction with the advisory note [URA/PB/2017/01-DCG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2017/Jan/dc17-01). Solar panel proposals are to also comply with relevant technical agencies' requirements.

12. I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.

13. For other information on the master plan, urban design guidelines, private property use and approval, car park locations and availability, private residential property transactions, and conservation areas and buildings, use [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) (Service Portal and Community e-Services). This is an online portal packed with useful data and visualisation to help building professionals, business operators and the general public in their decision-making. It consolidates detailed information on land use and private property into a one-stop platform presented on geospatial maps.

Thank You.

1 You may visit [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) to find out if your development is located in these areas by referring to the Control Plan "Street Block, Urban Design Area, Conservation & Monuments Plan".

2 You may refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

3 URA can consider proposals where greenery and solar panels are co-located.
