CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Developers, architects and engineers

  

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

  

1.  URA has refined the GFA rules for sky terraces, pedestrian linkages, balconies and mechanical & electrical (M&E) spaces. The refinements take into account industry feedback on the need for more efficient calculation of GFA, by enhancing the clarity and objectivity of the GFA rules.

2.  The criteria that have been refined are summarised in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-11/dc19-11-App1.pdf). Please refer to the [URA Development Control handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control) for the complete list of criteria and the most updated guidelines and procedures.

3.  The refinements to the GFA rules will apply with immediate effect to all development applications. In the event a floor space was previously approved as GFA but is no longer counted as GFA under the current refinements, the approved GFA could be used to off-set any additional floor space proposed under an amendment or additions/alterations submission, until the 'credit' GFA is exhausted. However, such proposals to utilise the 'credit' GFA will be assessed based on planning considerations applicable to the context of the site, for example traffic impact.

4.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.
