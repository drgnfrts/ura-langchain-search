1.  URA is pleased to invite Singapore-based practising designers in architecture and landscape design-related fields to take part in the PLAY @ Punggol design competition to design installations along Punggol Waterway. This competition is organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and supported by the National Parks Board (NParks) and JTC Corporation, with the Singapore Institute of Architects as the appointed Promoter.  
      
    
2.  Public spaces play a pivotal role in fostering connections between people and places. Through the installations, the project aims to promote interactions amongst members of the public, enhance public space experiences, and showcase the identity of Punggol. With a pipeline of developments over the next decade and beyond, designers play a critical role in shaping our urban environment. The PLAY @ Punggol design competition provides an opportunity for practising designers to contribute towards the design and activation of our public spaces in Singapore.  
      
    
3.  Sited at three distinct locations along the waterway, the designs of the installations shall be inspired by the flora, fauna and rich history of Punggol. Using recycled wood logs, the installations shall be designed to be delightful, encourage a sense of play, and bring communities together. The installations will be installed for a minimum duration of three years.
