Covered linkways are to be provided to bridge connectivity gaps where adjacent covered walkways are not aligned. A minimum 3.6m wide (and 3.0m clear) continuous covered walkway is to be provided to abut the lines of Road Reserve along North Bridge Road, Beach Road and Middle Road. A minimum 3.0m wide (and 2.4m clear) continuous covered walkway is to be provided to abut the lines of Road Reserve along Seah Street, Purvis Street, Liang Seah Street and Tan Quee Lan Street. The covered walkways are: 1. To have a maximum external soffit height of 3.6m measured from the covered walkway level. Higher soffit heights can be considered, subject to the provision of drop-panels or the width of the walkway being increased to match the higher height. This is to ensure adequate weather protection for pedestrians during inclement weather; 2. To abut, open out onto and match the level of the open walkways within the adjacent Road Reserves and the covered walkways of the adjacent developments; 3. To be at a constant level throughout the entire length. Where there are differences in level with the adjacent open walkways or the covered walkways of abutting developments, ramps must be built to mediate the differences. Steps are only allowed for steep gradients where ramps are not possible; and 4. Where there is a level difference between the covered walkway and the 1st storey of the development, ramps or steps between the two levels must be built within the 1st storey level of the development and not within the covered walkway. |
