CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

Who Should Know:  
Developers, Building Owners, Property Managers, Architects and Engineers

1.  The [Loading Bay Design and Operation Guide](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Jul/dc20-05---Guideline.pdf) facilitates the better design and management of loading bay operations by commercial building owners. This guide provides information, best practices and recommendations regarding the operation of the Loading Bay within commercial buildings.
2.  The best practices shared should achieve the following objectives for the Loading Bay:
    - Efficient loading/unloading turnaround time.
    - Improve traffic safety and goods flow.
    - Adapt to changing delivery trends.
3.  We urge all building owners, developers and QPs to refer to the Best Practice Guide when developing new commercial buildings or when redeveloping existing commercial buildings, especially for buildings with large retail components. In cases where it is difficult to adhere to the good practice for the design and operation of the Loading Bay, we encourage buildings owners to explore other means to achieve the same design and operation principles.
4.  The Best Practice Guide supplements the technical agencies' prevailing Code of Practices, requirements or design standards, which should take precedence.
