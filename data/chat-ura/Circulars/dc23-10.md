CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

Who Should Know:  
Qualified Persons

Effective Date:  
01 Dec 2023

1.  URA and LTA have developed a submission checklist to guide Qualified Persons (QPs) making development application (DA) submissions for rapid transit system (RTS) stations, in response to the complex nature of RTS station design and sensitive project timelines.

2.  The RTS DA Checklist ([Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg-/media/A0A29501C6684CD7936544E03C5E9E87.ashx)) provides a summary of the key requirements that need to be met for the first development application1 for all RTS stations island-wide.

3.  It is mandatory to submit the RTS DA Checklist in the first submission as part of the DA submission to URA to facilitate the evaluation of the proposal.
    - a)   If you are unable to fully comply with the relevant requirements, please make a declaration upfront on the non-compliances and provide the necessary justifications in the respective tables provided in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg-/media/A0A29501C6684CD7936544E03C5E9E87.ashx).
    - b)   Items under section I and II are requirements to facilitate smooth processing of the submission, pertaining to the documentation of Formal Planning Approval (FPA) and Architectural Design Review Panel (ADRP) conditions (where applicable), as well as drawing standards. If the requirements are not met or if any information provided is inaccurate, the entire submission will not be evaluated.
    - c)   Items under section III are critical issues for the grant of PP, pertaining to development boundary, integration, land take and connectivity. If the items are not in compliance, please provide justification that has been approved by the relevant authorities and ensure the information provided is accurate, otherwise PP will not be granted.
    - d)   Items under section IV are detailed design requirements pertaining to connectivity and M&E screening. If the requirements are not met either in part or in whole or if any information provided is inaccurate, we reserve the right not to evaluate related aspects of the proposal.
  
4.  QPs are to resolve all issues as early as possible prior to submitting a development application. A meeting with URA and LTA to review the submission materials is also encouraged prior to submission.

5.  QPs are to note that the Urban Design (UD) Checklist for DA submissions within Urban Design areas (Circular No. URA/PB/2022/05-CUDG) is not applicable for RTS station DA submissions and only the RTS DA Checklist is required.

6.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organization. You are advised to refer to the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control) and URA's website for updated guidelines instead of referring to past circulars.

7.  For other information on the Master Plan, Urban Design guidelines, private property use and approval, car park locations and availability, private residential property transactions, and conservation areas and buildings, use [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) (Service Portal and Community e-Services). This is an online portal packed with useful data and visualisations to help building professionals, business operators and the general public in their decision-making. It consolidates detailed information on land use and private property into a one-stop platform presented on geospatial maps. For feedback or enquiries on this circular, please [email](https://www.ura.gov.sg/feedbackWeb/contactus_feedback.jsp) us.

Thank You.
