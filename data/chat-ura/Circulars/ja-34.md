This has been superseded by the latest advisory. Please refer to the [Circulars](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars) page.

1.  As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 14 May 2021, existing Safe Management Measures (SMM) will be revised from 16 May 2021 till 13 June 2021 (both dates inclusive).
  
3.  Developers are required to implement the following changes to the SMM for their show galleries, with effect from 16 May till 13 June 2021:
  

1.  the maximum capacity for the show gallery and within the show unit(s) will be based on **16 sqm per person** instead of 10 sqm per person (rounded down to nearest whole number);
  
3.  the maximum number of persons in each group is reduced from 5 to **2 persons per group**, including any visitor, salesperson or developer's staff; and
  
5.  **no food and beverage shall be consumed in the show galleries**, so that no one should remove their masks at all times in the show galleries.

  
7.  Download the revised SMM checklist [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2021/May/CHECKLIST-ON-SAFE-MANAGEMENT-MEASURES-IN-SHOW-GALLERY_20210514.docx).
