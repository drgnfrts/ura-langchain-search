# Building Height

Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height of HMC developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA). Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

---

## Floor-to-Floor Height

The maximum floor-to-floor height of HMC developments is 5.0m.

## Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate. If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, HMC developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

### Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height

- Proposed Storey Height of Development: 7 - 20
- Additional Building Height Allowed: 10.0m

- Proposed Storey Height of Development: 21 - 30
- Additional Building Height Allowed: 15.0m

- Proposed Storey Height of Development: 31 - 40
- Additional Building Height Allowed: 20.0m

- Proposed Storey Height of Development: 41 - 50
- Additional Building Height Allowed: 25.0m

- Proposed Storey Height of Development: More than 50
- Additional Building Height Allowed: 30.0m

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

## Restrictions on Additional Building Height

Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height. The overall building height is subject to technical height controls. The additional building height shall not apply to:

1. Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
2. Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3. Developments with special controls e.g. areas with streetblock plans.

In addition to (a) â€“ (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.
