# Building Setback from Boundary

All HMC developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the external wall of the building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All HMC developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below. Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Central Area, which is guided by Urban Design guidelines.

## Road Buffer, Green Buffer

| Road Category                | Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                   | 15m (5m)                                                      |
| Category 2                   | 7.5m (3m)                                                     |
| Category 3                   | 5m (3m)                                                       |
| Category 4 - 5 and slip road | 5m (3m)                                                       |

## Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip

| Type of Boundary                        | Building Setback Requirement               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Common boundary with other developments | Minimum 4.5m (including 2m planting strip) |

## Setback for Building Appendages

| Building Feature                               | Within Road Buffer                                  | Within Setback from Common Boundaries                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roof eaves                                     | Allowed, provided it is not within the green buffer | Allowed, provided it is not within the 2.0m planting strip |
| Sun-shading devices & RC ledges (cantilevered) | Allowed, provided it is not within the green buffer | Allowed, provided it is not within the 2.0m planting strip |
