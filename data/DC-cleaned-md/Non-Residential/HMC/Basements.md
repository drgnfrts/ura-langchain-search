# Basements

A basement is a sunken structure with a maximum protrusion of 1.0m above the ground level on all sides. If the protrusion is more than 1.0m above the ground level regardless of the number of protruded sides, it shall be treated as a storey.

## Basement Setback and Vertical Openings

### Basement Setback
Type of Basement Setback from the Road Reserve Line Setback from Other Boundaries
Basement with protrusion Up to the road buffer Up to the building setback
Sunken basement Up to the road reserve line, provided the portion underneath the green buffer is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level Up to the site lot boundary, provided:
- the portion underneath the 2m tree planting strip is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level;
- there are no technical requirements (eg sewerage, drainage) and the basement does not cause any adverse impact to the adjoining property;
- the side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site.

Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:
- While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (i.e., the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
- The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
- Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
- The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
- Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.
