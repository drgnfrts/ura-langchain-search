# Gross Plot Ratio

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) is subject to evaluation, taking into consideration the location, site context, topography, traffic situation, impact of the HMC development on the surroundings and other agencies’ requirements.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) – see figure below.
