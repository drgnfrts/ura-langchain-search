# Use Quantum

At least 60% of the total B1 industrial GFA (i.e., minimum 60%) shall be used for industrial purpose<sup>1</sup>. The remaining 40% may be used for ancillary (or supporting) uses. Tables 1 and 2 below show the applicable use quantum control for a single-user or multi-user industrial development.

## Single-User Development

*Single-User Use Quantum*

- **Predominant**: Minimum 60%
- **Ancillary**: Maximum 40%

***Note***: For single-user developments, strata subdivision is not allowed. Sub-leasing of space is allowed.

## Multi-User Development

*Multi-User Development Overall Use Quantum*  
*Use Quantum within each Strata Unit*

- **Predominant**: Minimum 60%
- **Ancillary**: Maximum 40%

*Entire Development*  

- Minimum 60%
- Maximum 40%

*Each Strata-subdivided Unit*  

- Minimum 60%
- Maximum 40%

Up to 40% of the floor area of the development is for ancillary quantum at the development level, which comprises all common areas outside the units (such as common corridors, staircases, lifts, toilets, M&E spaces) and all secondary uses (see the *‘Guidelines for Allowable Uses’* section [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B1/Allowable-Uses)). Within each strata-subdivided industrial unit, at least 60% of the floor area shall be used for industrial uses.
