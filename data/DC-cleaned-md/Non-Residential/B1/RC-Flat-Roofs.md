# RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only<sup>1</sup>. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls and the following guidelines.

**Height controls applicable, include:**

- Absolute technical height constraints (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
- Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet specific criteria such as maximum area or roof coverage.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered with certain criteria to optimize performance and minimize impact on the surroundings. Installation does not require planning permission in some locations and contexts.

#### Planning Permission

Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape. For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without additional works is treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance.

Definitions:
**Elevated solar panels:** located in developments on specified land use zones shall require planning permission.
**Spaces under solar panels:** are enclosed or put to commercial use. Planning permission is required in such instances.
