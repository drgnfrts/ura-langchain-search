### Building Setback from Boundary

All industrial developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the external wall of the building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All industrial developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

**Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Road Buffer, Green Buffer

**Table 1: Road Buffer, Green Buffer**

| Road Category               | Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Category 1                  | 15m (5m)                                |
| Category 2                  | 7.5m (3m)                               |
| Category 3                  | 5m (3m)                                 |
| Category 4 - 5 and slip road | 5m (3m)                                 |

**Table 2: Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip**

| Type of Boundary                      | Building Setback Requirement                                |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Common boundary with non-industrial development | Minimum 4.5m (No planting strip requirement)                |
| Common boundary with industrial development       | - No setback requirement (see note below).                 <br>- No openings along common boundary.                     |
| Common boundary with a Place of Worship          | No setback (see note below) is required at the common boundary between an industrial development and a Place of Worship (PW) development subject to the following conditions:             <br>          - The sites are located well within the industrial estate and not next to a Reserve site or other non-industrial developments; <br>          - No openings along common boundary; and <br>          - No adverse impact on the surrounding developments. |
  
***Note***: Where a building is proposed to abut the common boundary, measures shall be put in place to facilitate downstream building maintenance at the common boundary.

| Building Feature                  | Within Road Buffer                                     | Within Setback from Common Boundaries                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Roof eaves                        | Allowed, provided it is not within the green buffer    | Allowed, provided it is not within the 2.0m planting strip |
| Sun-shading devices & RC ledges (cantilevered) | -                                                 | -                                                      |
