# Gross Plot Ratio

The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a BP development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). The upper bound GPR may not always be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve(1) and/or Road Reserve(2) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR â€“ see figure below.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Drainage Reserve: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.
