# Building Height

## Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height of BP developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

## Floor-to-Floor Height

There is no floor-to-floor height control for BPs.

## Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, BPs with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below.

### Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height

**Proposed Storey Height of Development**

- 7 - 20: 10.0m
- 21 - 30: 15.0m
- 31 - 40: 20.0m
- 41 - 50: 25.0m
- More than 50: 30.0m

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.
