# Introduction

Business Parks (BP) are for businesses engaged in high-technology, research and development (R&D), high value-added and knowledge intensive activities. BPs have the following distinguishing features:

- A range or variety of activities or uses which are technology and research-oriented industries and non-manufacturing in nature;
- Have generous and lush landscaping, quality building designs, and wider range and variety of amenities and facilities.

BPs can be developed on land zoned BP and BP-White. The White component is a flexible provision to allow for more GFA quantum to accommodate related uses synergistic with the dominant BP land use zoning. Related uses include residential, office, hotel, sports and recreation uses. The allowable quantum for White use is higher for land zoned BP-White.
