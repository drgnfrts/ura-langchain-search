# Introduction

Civic and Community Institutions comprise developments for civic, community, cultural, association/clan, or other similar purposes on land zoned “Civic & Community Institution” (C&CI) and “Residential/Institution” in the Master Plan.

Examples of C&CI developments include:

- **Civic**: Courts, Police Stations, Fire Stations, Special Government Buildings, Prisons
- **Community**: Association/Clan Buildings, Community Clubs/Centres, Welfare Homes, Home for the Aged, Funeral Parlours, Childcare Centres
- **Cultural**: Performing Arts Centre, Library, Museum, Arts/Science Centre, Art Gallery

A C&CI building may be a stand-alone or party-wall building. The actual allowable building form will be assessed taking into account the site location, site context, and detailed development guidelines in the prevailing street block plans, if any.

Strata subdivision is not allowed for C&CI developments.

All C&CI developments shall adhere to the planning parameters and guidelines except for Community Centres/Clubs and Homes for the Aged – see their guidelines under the tab [Home for the Aged](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/Home) and [Community Centres/Clubs](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/CC) respectively.
