# Home for the Aged or Home for the Disabled

Purpose-built Homes for the Aged or Homes for the Disabled are meant to provide residential accommodation with board and care for the elderly and the disabled respectively.

Homes for the Aged are licensed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

Free-standing or independent Homes for the Aged/Disabled are typically zoned "Civic and Community Institution" or "Residential/Institution" in the Master Plan. They may be allowed at the void decks of public housing blocks as facilities ancillary to the residential use.

Conversion of properties to Homes for the Aged or Disabled and the actual allowable building form (i.e., stand-alone or party-wall) will be assessed taking into account the site location, site context and detailed development guidelines in the prevailing street block plans, if any.

## Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The allowable gross plot ratio and number of storeys for Homes for the Aged or Disabled developments shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

Homes for the Aged or Disabled of 3-storeys and above shall be provided with lifts.

For the redevelopment of an existing approved Home for the Aged or Disabled to carry out major extensions to it, the proposed increase in GPR or GFA is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the home, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.
