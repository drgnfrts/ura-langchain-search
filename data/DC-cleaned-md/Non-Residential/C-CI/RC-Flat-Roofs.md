# RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only<sup>1</sup>. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls and the following guidelines.

### Assessment of Storey Height

#### Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels
- **Extent**: Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level
- **Height**: Maximum 5m above roof level

### Planning Permission
Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas<sup>2</sup> shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.
**For Conservation Areas**: Installation of solar panels without any additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation) and information on submission procedure [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works).

# Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet certain criteria:
- Maximum 500sqm<sup>1</sup> or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
- For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally.
- For developments not subject to storey height control, a maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
- Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery, visible from the surroundings.

# Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:
1. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane.
2. The installation shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Elevated solar panels located in developments on specific land use zones shall require planning permission:

- Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
- Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
- Mixed Commercial & Residential
- Commercial
- Hotel
- White
- Residential / Institution
- Commercial / Institution
- Educational Institution
- Place of Worship
- Civic & Community Institution
