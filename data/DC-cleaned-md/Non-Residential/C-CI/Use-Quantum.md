# Use Quantum

C&CI developments are expected to be used primarily for C&CI activities. Ancillary offices may be allowed if they support the primary function of the C&CI development or institution. Limited commercial uses such as a small shop may be allowed in C&CI developments. The actual commercial quantum is subject to evaluation depending on the merits of the proposal, site location, site context, and its impact on the surrounding area.
