# Golf Courses

Golf courses may vary in size from a 9-hole, 18-hole to 36-hole course. They may be a public or private golf course. Most of them would have facilities for a driving range, a clubhouse, chalets, guesthouses, other ancillary recreational facilities, and limited commercial uses. The ancillary and limited commercial uses may be considered subject to the following requirements:

## Guest Houses or Chalets

Chalets and guest houses are accommodation facilities provided within the golf courses. They shall not exceed 30% of the total proposed GFA or 10,000sqm, whichever is the lower. These facilities may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

## Commercial Uses

Commercial uses such as restaurants, bars and lounges, outdoor refreshment areas, canteens, saloons, and pro shops shall not exceed 30% of the total proposed GFA or 4,000sqm, whichever is lower. SLA may assess such commercial uses based on Group A (Commercial) rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

## Subdivision

Land or strata-subdivision is not allowed for golf course developments, including any allowable commercial and ancillary guest house/chalet facilities.
