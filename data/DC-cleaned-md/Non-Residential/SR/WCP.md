- Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments.
- Provision of measures to minimize conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points.
- Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers.
- Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists.
- Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly, and mobility-challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarized in [LTA’s Code of Practice “Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works”](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance in developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies’ prevailing COPs, engineering, and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).
