# RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls and the following guidelines.

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet specific criteria. 

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet certain criteria:

1. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimize performance and minimize glare.
2. The installation shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

#### Planning Permission

Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.
