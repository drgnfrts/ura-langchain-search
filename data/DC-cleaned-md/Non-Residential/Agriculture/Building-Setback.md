# Building Setback from Boundary

All Agriculture developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve<sup>[2†source]</sup> line or boundary line to the external wall of the agriculture building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All Agriculture developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the road category. The classification of the road category may be obtained from LTA's Road Interpretation Plan (RIP). A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

**Road Buffer and Green Buffer**

- **Category 1**:
  - Minimum Road Buffer: 15m (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)
- **Category 2**:
  - Minimum Road Buffer: 7.5m (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)
- **Category 3**:
  - Minimum Road Buffer: 5m (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)
- **Category 4 & 5**:
  - Minimum Road Buffer: 5m (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)

**Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip**

- Along common boundaries with non-agriculture developments, drainage reserve and backlanes:
  - Minimum Building Setback Requirement: 4.5m (including 2m planting strip)

- Along common boundaries with other agriculture developments:
  - Minimum Building Setback Requirement: 2m (no planting strip required)

# Setback for Building Appendages

- **Building Feature**:
  - Within Road Buffer: Allowed, provided it is not within green buffer
  - Within Setback from Common Boundaries: Allowed, provided it is not within the 2.0m planting strip
