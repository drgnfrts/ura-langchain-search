# Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the agriculture site and should not be proposed within the building setback distance. Ancillary structures proposed within the building setback distance and their height are subject to evaluation.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in accordance with NPARKS' guidelines â€“ see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).
