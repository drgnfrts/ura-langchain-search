# Walking and Cycling Plan (WCP)

## Submission of WCP

Developments with expected high pedestrian and cyclist traffic are required to provide a WCP as part of the Development Application. As a guide, development types listed in the table below are subject to WCP requirement.

### Development Types that require WCP as part of TIA<sup>1</sup>

**Residential**
- 1.1 ≥ 700 units
- 1.2 ≥ 1,000 units

**Commercial**
- 2.1 ≥ 10,000sqm GFA
- 2.2 ≥ 20,000sqm GFA
- 2.3 ≥ 700 rooms

**Industrial**
- 3.1 ≥ 60,000sqm GFA
- 3.2 ≥ 50,000sqm GFA
- 3.3 ≥ 40,000sqm GFA

**Educational**
- 4.1 ≥ 1,500 students (single-session) or ≥ 2,000 students (double-session)
- 4.2 to 4.5 - Different requirements
- TIA Required

**Medical**
- ≥ 40,000sqm GFA or ≥ 320 Beds (whichever is triggered first)

**Recreational**
- ≥ 30,000sqm GFA

While PW developments are not listed in the table above, they may also be required to submit a WCP if they fall under specific criteria such as being located in car-lite precincts or within 400m of major transport nodes or are Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

## Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate various elements in the design of the development:

- Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments
- Provision of measures to minimize conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicles
- Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces
- Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists
- Provision of barrier-free access and routes for specific groups

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarized in LTA’s Code of Practice “Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works”.

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies’ prevailing COPs, engineering, and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).
