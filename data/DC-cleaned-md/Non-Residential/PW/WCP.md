While PW developments are not listed in the table above, they may also be required to submit a WCP if they fall under the following criteria:

- Developments located in car-lite precincts(4); or
- Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, ie within Zone 2(5); or
- Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Developments that have a master developer, and consist of two or more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit a WCP at the concept design stage.
- (2) LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.
- (3) Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.
- (4) The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.
- (5) Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to [LTA's website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for more details.

## Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the design of the development:

- Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public transport facilities and adjacent developments;
- Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
- Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and lockers;
- Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and amenities for cyclists; and
- Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are summarised in LTA’s Code of Practice [“Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works”](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies’ prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).
