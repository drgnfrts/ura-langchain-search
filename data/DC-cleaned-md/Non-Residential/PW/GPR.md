# Gross Plot Ratio

The guideline on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for new PWs varies depending on the location and the context of the surrounding area. The allowable GPR in the table below is the upper bound. The actual allowable GPR would depend on the site conditions, traffic situation, impact of the PW on the nearby developments, and other agencies’ requirements.

**Allowable Gross Plot Ratio**

## Location
Within landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4  
Up to 1.0

At the fringe of landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4  
Up to 1.4

Within HDB estates and in areas with GPR more than 1.4   
Up to 1.6

Within or at the fringe of industrial estates  
Up to 1.6

Within Central Area and within other commercial centres, including party-wall developments such as in Geylang area  
Subject to evaluation and localised urban design guidelines.

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage reserve (DR) and/or road reserve (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

**Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain  
**Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

[GPR for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

## GPR for sites where vesting is required

For redevelopment of existing approved PW developments or to carry out major extensions to them, the proposed increase in GPR or Gross Floor Area (GFA) is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the PW, context of the surrounding area, and requirements of other government agencies such as LTA. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.
