# Building Setback from Boundary

Setback Requirements

![Setback Requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/PW02_Road_Buffer_Setbacks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

All PWs shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve^(1) line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All PWs fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below. Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Geylang area or the Central Area, both of which are guided by Urban Design guidelines.

### Table 1: Road Buffer, Green Buffer

| Road Category                | Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                   | 15m (5m)                                                      |
| Category 2                   | 7.5m (3m)                                                     |
| Category 3                   | 5m (3m)                                                       |
| Category 4 - 5 and slip road | 5m (3m)                                                       |

| Common boundary with other developments        | Minimum 4.5m (including 2m planting strip)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Common boundary with an industrial development | No setback (see note below) is required at the common boundary between an industrial development and a Place of Worship (PW) development subject to the following conditions: The sites are located well within the industrial estate and not next to non-industrial developments; No openings along common boundary; and No adverse impact on the surrounding developments. Note: Where the building is proposed to abut the common boundary, the applicant should put in place systems/measures to facilitate down-stream building maintenance at the common boundary. |
