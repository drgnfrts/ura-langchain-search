# Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area

In line with the planning intention to encourage conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses (see examples in the table below) will be considered in selected areas where [CBD Incentive Scheme](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04) applies.

## Locality

### Areas where CBD Incentive Scheme applies
Only non-office uses will be allowed. Examples of possible non-office uses<sup>4</sup>:  

a. Residential  
b. Shops e.g. minimart, laundrette, hair salons, etc.  
c. Clinics  
d. Restaurants  
e. Indoor farms  
f. Gymnasium/Fitness centres  
g. Childcare centres  
h. Commercial schools  
This is not an exhaustive list. Allowable uses will be subject to planning evaluation and will therefore vary from site to site.

## Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, commercial and mixed use developments shall provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

## Loading Bay

We advise all building owners, developers and QPs to refer to the [Loading Bay Design and Operations Best Practice Guide](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Jul/dc20-05---Guideline.pdf) when developing new commercial buildings or when redeveloping existing commercial buildings, especially for buildings with large retail components.

This guide provides information, best practices and recommendations regarding the design and operation of the loading bays within commercial buildings, to achieve the following objectives:

- Efficient loading/unloading turnaround time
- Improve traffic safety and goods flow
- Adapt to changing delivery trends

In cases where it is difficult to adhere to the good practice for the design and operation of the loading bays, we encourage buildings owners to explore other means to achieve the same design and operation principles.
