# Introduction

Commercial developments include office buildings, shopping malls, convention/exhibition centres, commercial schools/banks, market and food centres/restaurants, cinemas, entertainment and trade missions. Some developments may contain a mix of commercial uses such as a shopping podium with an office tower block above.

The form of a commercial development may vary from a free-standing, podium/tower arrangement, to a party-wall development. The resultant building form depends on the location and street block plans for the site.

Commercial developments can be developed on land zoned:

- Commercial;
- Mixed Commercial and Residential; or
- Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
