# Urban Design Requirements

Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) intentions are to preserve and enhance the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

## Urban Design Requirements

Developments in the Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District, and Woodlands Central), may be guided by specific [urban design requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design), where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

Refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=urbandesign) for the Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

## Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

- a. Urban Design Areas shown in the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design Plan;
- b. Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
- c. Sites that undergo redevelopment or major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning conditions issued for these works;
- d. Other areas as directed and specified by the Competent Authority.

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

- a. 1st storey of developments fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
- b. Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments;
- c. Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2nd storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact on the surrounding developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not directly contribute to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause amenity problems to neighbors.

### Example of uses that may be considered as Activity Generating Uses (AGUs) are:

- Shop
- Showroom/ galleries
- Restaurant
- Pet shop/pet grooming
- Banks, adjoining or independent ATM clusters
- Commercial school
- Childcare center/kindergarten
- Gym/fitness center
- Visitor Center/ museum
- Hotel/ Backpackersâ€™ hostel
- Self-service laundry

### The following uses are not AGUs:

- Office
- Bar
- Nightclub
- Massage establishment
- LAN gaming center
