**Retail Unit Size**

The average retail unit size shall not be less than 50sqm. Average retail unit size is determined using the following formula:

## Internal Corridor Width

### Type of Corridor: Single Loaded (single row of retail units)
- **Primary Corridor<sup>1</sup> (with expected high footfall)**: Minimum 2.4m
- **Secondary Corridor<sup>2</sup>**: Minimum 2.0m

### Type of Corridor: Double Loaded (retail units on both sides)
- **Primary Corridor<sup>1</sup> (with expected high footfall)**: Minimum 3.0m
- **Secondary Corridor<sup>2</sup>**: Minimum 2.4m

<sup>1 </sup>Primary corridors are thoroughfares where high foot traffic is expected. These are typically the routes between the main entrances and exits of the development. Each commercial development shall provide at least 1 primary corridor and indicate this on the plan.

<sup>2 </sup>Secondary corridors refer to all other corridors.

For other types of corridor width requirements, refer to relevant guidelines (e.g., BCA Approved Document and SCDF Fire Code). Where a corridor is required to fulfill other functions (e.g., Accessible Corridor), the minimum corridor width shall take reference from whichever corridor width requirement that is greater.

Note: A wider corridor width may be required for corridors with expected heavy pedestrian traffic.
