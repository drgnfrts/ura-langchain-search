Areas where strata subdivision of the commercial component of commercial and mixed-use developments may not be allowed are as follows:

| Plan     | Location                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan 1-1 | [Along Orchard Road, Tanglin Road and Scotts Road (Orchard Road corridor)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/Orchard_Appendix-1-1.pdf)                                                        |
| Plan 1-2 | [Along Shenton Way, Robinson Road, Anson Road, Raffles Quay, facing Raffles Place Park, and along the Singapore River (CBD corridor)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/CBD_Appendix-1-2.pdf) |
| Plan 1-3 | [In close proximity to key landmarks of national significance](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/Civic-District_Appendix-1-3.pdf)                                                             |

URA may also impose strata subdivision restrictions on other sites of strategic importance in Central Area and Outside Central Area based on the context and significance of each site.

Restrictions on strata subdivision will also be imposed on developments that are approved under the CBD Incentive Scheme or Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) Scheme.

As the intention of the guidelines is to
limit the number of strata lots within a development to avoid fragmented ownership, strata subdivision for the purpose of delineating boundaries between different uses within mixed-use developments will continue to be permitted. For example, office and retail uses within a development can each form a strata lot.
