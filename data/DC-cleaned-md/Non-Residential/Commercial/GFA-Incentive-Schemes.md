# Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

Commercial developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

- Commercial developments may make use of any combination of the bonus GFA incentive schemes (i.e., CSFS and Rooftop Greenery ORA), as long as the cumulative bonus GFA does not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.

## Community and Sports Facilities Scheme

The Community and Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS) facilitates the co-location of compatible community and sports uses with highly accessible commercial developments. Under the CSFS, bonus GFA for the community and sports uses is subject to an overall cap of 10% of the maximum permissible GFA for the site allowed under the prevailing Master Plan or 2,000sqm (whichever is lower).

### Eligible Commercial Developments

The co-location of community or sports uses under the CSFS is intended primarily for commercial retail developments, which are highly accessible. The commercial development that may be considered for the community and/or sports uses under the CSFS shall be in close proximity to transport nodes or town centres/neighbourhood centres, and the additional CSFS space may be supported from the land use and transport planning points of view.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS would not be supported in hotel developments, as the resultant synergies are limited.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS in office developments shall only be considered if it is clear that the use has clear synergies with the office development and caters to the needs of the office workers.

### Allowable Community and Sports Uses

The proposed community and sports uses shall primarily be intended for public or community use and not profit-driven, with the exception of commercial child care centres endorsed by the Early Development Childhood Agency (ECDA). Refer to the table below for a list of allowable uses.
