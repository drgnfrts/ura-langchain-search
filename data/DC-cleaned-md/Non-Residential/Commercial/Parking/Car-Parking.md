# Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area

In line with the planning intention to encourage conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses will be considered in selected areas where [CBD Incentive Scheme](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04) applies.

### Locality
Allowable Change-of-Use for Surplus Carparks

**Areas where CBD Incentive Scheme applies**
Only non-office uses will be allowed. Examples of possible non-office uses¹:  
a. Residential  
b. Shops e.g. minimart, laundrette, hair salons, etc.  
c. Clinics  
d. Restaurants  
e. Indoor farms  
f. Gymnasium /Fitness centres  
g. Childcare centres  
h. Commercial schools  
¹This is not an exhaustive list. Allowable uses will be subject to planning evaluation and will therefore vary from site to site.

**Rest of Central Area**  
Non-office uses are highly encouraged.

### Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, commercial and mixed use developments shall provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s [Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

# Parking

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

### Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle¹ parking provision requirements.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

**Range-based Parking Provision Standards**

#### Provision of Surplus Parking in New Developments

New commercial and mixed use² developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, i.e., parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

If LTA approves the waiver, each surplus car parking lot shall be computed as 35sqm GFA, that being the average area of a car parking lot inclusive of circulation space. Each surplus motor-cycle parking lot shall be computed as 12sqm GFA.

Additional GFA arising from the surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.  
² Developments with commercial and/or hotel components that form more than 20% of the total GFA

#### Conversion of Surplus Car Parking in Existing Developments

Existing commercial developments within the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) or within 400m of MRT and LRT stations may be allowed to permanently convert their surplus car parking lots³ to other uses.

³ With the RPPS, surplus car parking lots in existing developments may arise if the upper bound for the development type is revised downward and/or if developments choose to reduce car parking provision to the lower bound set out by the RPPS.
