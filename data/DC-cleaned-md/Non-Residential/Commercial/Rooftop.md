# Elevated Solar Panels
Elevated solar panels located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:

- Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
- Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
- Mixed Commercial & Residential
- Commercial
- Hotel

and

- White
- Residential / Institution
- Commercial / Institution
- Educational Institution
- Place of Worship
- Civic & Community Institution

A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from the roof level for other developments.

### Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use

Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

**Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels:**

- **Extent:** Within the 45-degree line from the springing line of the roof level.
- **Height:** Maximum 5m above roof level.

# RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls and the following guidelines.

**Height controls applicable include:**

- Absolute technical height constraints (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
- Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet specific criteria, including maximum area or percentage of roof coverage. For developments under storey height control, remaining open-sided is necessary to prevent forming an additional storey. Integration with lush greenery is essential, and a Landscape Plan is required for submission with the Development Application.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet certain criteria related to angle and maintenance of greenery under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme. Installation in specific locations and contexts may require planning permission based on urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas.
