Setback requirements

![Image 2: Road buffer and setback](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C05_Road_Buffer_and_Setbacks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

All buildings in commercial developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All buildings in commercial developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in the tables below.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

| Road Category                | Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer in brackets) |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                   | 15m (5m)                                            |
| Category 2                   | 7.5m (3m)                                           |
| Category 3                   | 5m (3m)                                             |
| Category 4 - 5 and slip road | 5m (3m)                                             |

Commercial developments in the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map.pdf) are guided by the urban design requirements, which may allow the development to abut the road reserve at the front.

Commercial developments outside the Central Area may abut the road reserve at the front, if there is site constraint or if there is an intention to retain the existing streetscape which is abutting the road reserve/road widening line.

### Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip

| Type of Boundary                        | Building Setback Requirement                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Common boundary with other developments | Minimum 3m (including 2m planting strip requirement) |

### Building Setback for Ancillary Structures

Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in accordance with NPARKS' guidelines – see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building setback that exceed the requirements in the table below, but are below 6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design and function.

| Type of Ancillary Structures | Required Setback from the Road                        | Required Setback from the Other Boundaries | Height Control                          |
