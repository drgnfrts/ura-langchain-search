# Parking

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

## Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

New B2 developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

### Private Parking Lots

Within multi-user developments, industrial strata units may be allowed to have their own private car/lorry parking lots subject to the following:

- The private parking lots are surplus parking lots over and above LTA’s minimum parking provision;
- The floor area of the private parking lots shall be computed as GFA under the 40% ancillary quantum of each strata-unit;
- The private parking lots are physically contiguous to the industrial strata unit.

For approved private car/lorry parking areas that were previously not computed as GFA, they may be converted to other allowable usable areas subject to the following:

- These areas are computed as GFA and the resultant GFA does not exceed the current MP GPR Control for the development site;
- The proposed conversion is authorized by the MCST via a 90% resolution;
- The remaining number of parking lots after conversion still meets LTA’s minimum parking provision;
- SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

## Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, B2 developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments.

Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.
