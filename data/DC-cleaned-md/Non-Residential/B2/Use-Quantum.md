# Use Quantum

At least 60% of the total B2 industrial GFA (i.e., minimum 60%) shall be used for industrial purpose<sup>1</sup>. The remaining 40% may be used for ancillary (or supporting) uses.

## Single-User Development

*Single-User Use Quantum*

**Table 1: Single User Development**

**Predominant** | **Ancillary**
--- | ---
Minimum 60% | Maximum 40%

*Note: For single-user developments, strata subdivision is not allowed. Sub-leasing of space is allowed.*

Single-user/owner developments (i.e., not strata subdivided) that sub-lease space to other tenants are subject to the same quantum controls as multi-user developments (see Table 2 below).

## Multi-User Development

*Multi-User Development Overall Use Quantum*

*Use Quantum within each Strata Unit*

**Table 2: Multi-User Development**

**Predominant** | **Ancillary**
--- | ---
**Entire Development** | 
Minimum 60% | Maximum 40% 
**Each Strata-subdivided Unit** | 
Minimum 60% | Maximum 40%

Up to 40% of the floor area of the development is for ancillary quantum at the development level, which comprises all common areas outside the units (such as common corridors, staircases, lifts, toilets, M&E spaces) and all secondary uses (see the *‘Guidelines for Allowable Uses’* section [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Allowable-Uses)).

Within each strata-subdivided industrial unit, at least 60% of the floor area shall be used for industrial uses.
