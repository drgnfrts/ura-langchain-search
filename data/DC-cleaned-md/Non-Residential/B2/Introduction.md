Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses, telecommunication, and utility buildings. These developments may be allowed on land zoned Business 1 (B1) or Business 2 (B2).

Depending on the nature of their activities, clean and light industries are allowed in Business 1 (B1) zone. General and special industries are to be located in Business 2 (B2) zone.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 100m nuisance buffer from a B2 zone to the surrounding area. The allowable types of industry or use within industrial developments in B2 zone, based on NEAâ€™s nuisance buffer requirements, are listed [here](https://e-services.nea.gov.sg/ias/PublicApplicant/Homepage.aspx).
