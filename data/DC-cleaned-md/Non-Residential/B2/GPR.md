# Gross Plot Ratio

The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a B2 development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). This upper bound GPR may not always be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve and/or Road Reserve to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

**Drainage Reserve**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.

**Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

## B2-White

**B2-White**

B2 sites located next to MRT stations may be zoned B2-W. The white component is to provide flexibility for industrial companies in such locations to accommodate synergistic White uses.

For such B2-W sites, a minimum GPR shall be achieved for the permissible B2 uses first. This minimum GPR for B2 uses is indicated in the square brackets on the Master Plan.

For example, in the map below, the site next to Joo Koon MRT Station is zoned “**2.5 \[B-2.0\] W**”. A B2-W site would have an overall allowable GPR of 2.5. A minimum GPR of 2.0 must be achieved and used for industrial purposes before the remaining GPR 0.5 may be unlocked for White uses.

Refer to the section on [Allowable Uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Allowable-Uses) for the list of allowable uses within the White component.
