<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/B201_Road_Buffer_Setbacks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

**Setback Requirements**

All industrial developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the external wall of the building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All industrial developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

## Road Buffer, Green Buffer

- **Road Category**  
  - Category 1  
    - Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): 15m (5m)
  - Category 2  
    - Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): 7.5m (3m)
  - Category 3  
    - Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): 5m (3m)
  - Category 4 - 5 and slip road  
    - Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): 5m (3m)

## Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip

- **Type of Boundary**: Common boundary with non-industrial development  
  - Building Setback Requirement: Minimum 4.5m (No planting strip requirement)

- **Type of Boundary**: Common boundary with industrial development  
  - Building Setback Requirement:  
    - No setback requirement (see note below).
    - No openings along common boundary.

- **Type of Boundary**: Common boundary with a Place of Worship  
  - Building Setback Requirement:  
    - No setback is required at the common boundary between an industrial development and a Place of Worship (PW) development subject to conditions:
      - The sites are located well within the industrial estate and not next to a Reserve site or other non-industrial developments;
      - No openings along common boundary;
      - No adverse impact on the surrounding developments.

*Note*: Where a building is proposed to abut the common boundary, measures shall be put in place to facilitate downstream building maintenance at the common boundary.
