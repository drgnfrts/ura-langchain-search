LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

### Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle(1) parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

New transport developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, i.e., parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

### Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, transport developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements. Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property. Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.
