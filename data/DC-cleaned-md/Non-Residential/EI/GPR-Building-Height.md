# Gross Plot Ratio & Building Height

Building Height of Education and Institution

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) and number of storeys for the EI shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. As a guide, depending on the allowable GPR, the corresponding number of storeys are shown in the table below. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, or be higher, depending on the site topography, site condition, and the context of the surrounding area.

**Allowable Gross Plot Ratio and Storey Height**

- *Location*: Within landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4
  - *Gross Plot Ratio Control*: Up to 1.0
  - *Guide for Storey Height*: Up to 2 or 3 storeys based on the storey-height control of the landed housing estate

- *Location*: At the fringe of landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4
  - *Gross Plot Ratio Control*: Up to 1.0
  - *Guide for Storey Height*: Up to 3 storeys

- *Location*: Within HDB estates and in areas with GPR more than 1.4
  - *Gross Plot Ratio Control*: Up to 1.4
  - *Guide for Storey Height*: Up to 4 storeys

- *Location*: Within or at the fringe of industrial estates
  - *Gross Plot Ratio Control*: Up to 1.4
  - *Guide for Storey Height*: Up to 4 storeys

- *Location*: Within Central Area and within other commercial centers, including party-wall developments such as in Geylang area
  - *Gross Plot Ratio Control*: Subject to evaluation and localized urban design guidelines

Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height<sup>1</sup> of EI developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

----

### Floor-to-Floor Height

The maximum floor-to-floor height of EI developments is 5.0m.

### Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, EI developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

**Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height**

- *Proposed Storey Height of Development*: 7 - 20
  - *Additional Building Height Allowed*: 10.0m

- *Proposed Storey Height of Development*: 21 - 30
  - *Additional Building Height Allowed*: 15.0m

- *Proposed Storey Height of Development*: 31 - 40
  - *Additional Building Height Allowed*: 20.0m

- *Proposed Storey Height of Development*: 41 - 50
  - *Additional Building Height Allowed*: 25.0m

- *Proposed Storey Height of Development*: More than 50
  - *Additional Building Height Allowed*: 30.0m

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:
1. Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
2. Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3. Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) â€“ (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.
