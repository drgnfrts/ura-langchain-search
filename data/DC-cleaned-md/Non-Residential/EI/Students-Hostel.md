# Students’ Hostels

A students’ hostel or dormitory is used for lodging by students unrelated by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship. The premises are considered as students’ hostel if:
- The total number of students staying in the premises exceed 6 students; and
- The premises is for accommodation facilities for full-time students studying in the local primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, and tertiary institutions.

Students’ hostels may either be ancillary to the EI development, for example as a separate dormitory building that serves students/staff of the school or independent developments.

## Location

Students’ hostel developments may be allowed on sites zoned Educational Institution, Commercial/Residential, and Residential with 1st storey Commercial.

Independent students’ hostel developments may also be allowed on sites zoned Residential provided that:
- The site shall not be located in estates safeguarded for landed housing only (e.g., Good Class Bungalow Areas);
- The site shall be located at the fringe of non-landed residential estates and in street blocks which already have non-residential uses;
- The site shall be fronting a category 2 or 3 road; and
- The amenity of the surrounding areas shall not adversely affect.

## Conversions of Existing Flats to Students’ Hostel

Conversion of existing flats to students’ hostel may be either on an en-bloc or a ‘per floor’ basis. Conversion on a ‘per floor’ basis (i.e., all the flat units on the same floor sharing a common staircase or lift access) may be considered only under a single Temporary Permission (TP) regardless of the number of owners involved, provided that it does not result in dis-amenity to other residents.

The students’ hostel shall be located below existing residential floors to minimize potential inconveniences and disturbances to the residents.

All owners shall submit a Letter of Undertaking (LOU) that the students’ hostel will be run by a single operator. For conversions on a per-floor basis, all owners on the floor are to sign the LOU. A fresh LOU shall be submitted for subsequent renewals of the TP.
