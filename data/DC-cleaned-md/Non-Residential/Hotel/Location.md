# Location

Hotel developments are allowed on land zoned "Hotel" in the Master Plan although some existing hotels approved some time ago may be occupying land currently not zoned Hotel.

Hotel developments located on land zoned Hotel or land zoned for other uses with a requirement to provide a minimum hotel quantum in the Master Plan are not allowed to be converted to other uses.

Hotel developments and backpackers' hostels may be considered on land that are not zoned for Hotel use in the Master Plan. Such cases shall be evaluated individually, taking into account the planning intention and compatibility with the surrounding land uses.

Areas where new hotel developments and backpackers' hostels are not allowed can be found [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Jun/dc18-04/dc18-04-AppA.pdf) (PDF, 12.9 MB).
