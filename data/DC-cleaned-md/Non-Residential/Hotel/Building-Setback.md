# Building Setback for MSCP

The building setback for multi-storey car parks (MSCP) is detailed below.

### Multi-Storey Car Parks

**Setback from Road:** Follow road buffer standards for hotel buildings  
**Minimum Width of Setback from Common Boundaries:** 6m (including 2m planting strip)

### Building Appendages

**Setback for Building Appendages**  
**Building Feature:** Roof Eaves  
**Within Road Buffer:** Allowed, provided it is not within the green buffer  
**Within Setback from Common Boundaries:** Allowed, provided it is not within the 2.0m planting strip



# Building Setback for Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

**Setback and Height Control for Ancillary Structures**

- **Electrical Substation**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** 5m from Category 1 road, 3m from Category 2 â€“ 5 roads  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** 2m  
  - **Height Control:** 6m

- **Sunken Swimming Pool**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Not applicable  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** 2m  
  - **Height Control:** Follow road buffer standards

- **Raised Swimming Pool**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Follow road buffer standards  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** 2m

- **Water Tank & Pump**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Follow road buffer standards  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** 2m

- **Meter Compartment**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Subject to evaluation  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** 2m  
  - **Height Control:** 1.8m if located within the green buffer

- **Bin Point**

  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Subject to evaluation  
  - **Required Setback from the Other Boundaries:** Subject to evaluation  
  - Adequate setback may have to be provided to minimize glare and noise disturbance to adjoining developments

- **Tennis Court**
  - **Required Setback from the Road:** Subject to evaluation

### Building Setback from Boundary

All buildings in hotel developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage purpose.

All buildings in hotel developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in the tables below.

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

**Road Category - Category 1**  
- **Minimum Width of Buffer:** 15m  
- **Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets):** 10m (5m)

**Road Category - Category 2**  
- **Minimum Width of Buffer:** 7.5m  
- **Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets):** 4.5m (3m)

**Road Category - Category 3**  
- **Minimum Width of Buffer:** 5m  
- **Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets):** 2m (3m)

**Road Category - Category 4 - 5 and slip road**  
- **Minimum Width of Buffer:** 5m  
- **Road Buffer (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets):** 2m (3m)

Hotel developments in the central area are guided by the urban design requirements, which may allow the development to abut the road reserve at the front.

### Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip

**Common Boundary Setback & Planting Strip**  
- **Type of Boundary:** Common boundary with other developments  
- **Minimum Width of Setback:** 3m (including 2m planting strip) 

### Building Setback for Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for ancillary structures are shown in the table below.
