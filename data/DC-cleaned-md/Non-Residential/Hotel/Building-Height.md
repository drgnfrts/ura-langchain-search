# Building Height & Aggregate Building Height

## Floor-to-Floor Height for Hotel Developments

The maximum floor-to-floor height for hotel developments is 5m, including the mezzanine floor. Variations in floor-to-floor height are subject to evaluation depending on the use and location of the floor. If permitted, the proposed building height shall not exceed the maximum building height control computed based on the permitted number of storeys.

## Overall Building Height Control

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height of hotel developments is subject to compliance with the technical height controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

## Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

**Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height**

- **Proposed Storey Height of Development**  
  7 - 20  
  21 - 30  
  31 - 40  
  41 - 50  
  More than 50  

- **Additional Building Height Allowed**  
  10.0m  
  15.0m  
  20.0m  
  25.0m  
  30.0m  

The additional building height can only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development.

## Number of Storeys

The number of storeys for hotel developments is guided by the [building height plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=BH). If the storey height is not specified in the building height plan, the number of storeys would be evaluated by taking into consideration the location, site context, site topography, and impact of the hotel development on the surroundings. Basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height. The overall building height is subject to technical height controls. The additional building height shall not apply to developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments, developments with height control of 6 storeys or less, or developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans. In addition to these restrictions, any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.
