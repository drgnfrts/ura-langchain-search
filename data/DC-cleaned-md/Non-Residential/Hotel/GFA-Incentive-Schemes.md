# Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

Hotel developments are eligible for bonus GFA if they satisfy the requirements of the following incentive schemes:

## Balcony Incentive Scheme

The GFA of balconies in hotel developments may be computed over and above the Master MP allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 10% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.

Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 10% of the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height, or use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master Plan, Building Height Plan, or Special and Detailed Control Plan.

Balcony designs shall adhere to the following guidelines and submission requirements:

### Location
Balconies shall be located away from M&E areas to safeguard the quality and usability of these spaces.

### Openness
Balconies shall have a continuous perimeter opening of at least 40%.  
[Balcony Perimeter Opening](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F07_Balcony_Perimeter_Opening.jpg)  
The portions of a balcony that face a parapet wall (e.g., a wall between the balconies of two adjoining units) not exceeding 1.3m in height are considered "open".  
The QP shall show the computation of perimeter opening for the proposed balconies on the floor plans.

### Screen
- Balconies shall not be enclosed with walls or glass panels as balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. Balcony screens may be allowed provided:
  - The balcony screens can be drawn open or retracted fully; and
  - The balcony screens allow for natural ventilation/airflow within the balcony at all times, even when the screens are fully drawn.
- Balcony screens shall be designed upfront and approved as part of the Development Application process for all new hotel developments with proposed balconies (including the hotel component of mixed-use developments). Section cuts of the louvres shall be provided to show that the screening is naturally ventilated at all times, even when closed.
- For existing developments without balcony screens, screens may be installed provided they fulfill the performance criteria above. Safety grilles are not considered as balcony screens, and such installation does not require planning approval.

## Rooftop ORA on Landscaped Roofs

Refer to the section on [Greenery](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel/Greenery).

## Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage the adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitization, productivity, and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA¹. Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) program prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

- Residential: Condominium and Flats development
- Non-Residential: Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital, or white site developments
- Mixed-use: Combination of the above

¹Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.

### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme². The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g., storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g., areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

²Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalization, productivity, and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA’s grant of the letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA’s grant of the Letter of Acceptance and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes are summarized at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

Applicants are to comply with BE ITM outcomes for the bonus scheme based on the [building type](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-building-type.pdf).
