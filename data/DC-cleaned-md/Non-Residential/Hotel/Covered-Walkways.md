# Provision of Open and Covered Public Walkways

All hotel developments shall provide covered walkways along the periphery of the building facing roads and pedestrian routes.

Covered walkways for hotel developments in the Central Area may be guided by urban design requirements. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

The specific urban design requirements for each planning area within the Central Area can be found on our [Urban Design](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) Website.

## Height of Covered Walkways

The soffit height of covered walkways is 3.6m.

Where higher ceiling height is desired, glass or other cladding may be provided at the edge of the covered walkway to achieve the 3.6m height.

A higher soffit height may be allowed in independent developments provided the walkway width is increased correspondingly to maintain the 45-degree angle, at main entrances to facilitate articulation, and on urban design grounds.

## Width of Covered Walkways

The minimum width for covered walkways varies depending on the location of the site and proximity to transport nodes. These are subject to urban design guidelines for selected locations with higher footfall eg Central Area, Regional Centres, and Key Growth Areas. For walkways wider than the minimum requirement, GFA exemption may be considered depending on merits of the proposal.

| Walkways between 200 â€“ 400m of MRT stations/major transport nodes              | 3m                    | 2.4m                |
| All other walkways                                                             | 2.4m                  | 2m                  |

## Location & Design of Covered Walkways

Covered walkways shall be provided at the periphery of the buildings next to or facing public roads.

The walkways shall be continuous, providing connections into the interior of the building, open space or open walkway. All ramps leading into the interior of the building shall begin outside the covered walkway.

Covered walkways shall be seamlessly connected to adjoining developments. Covered linkways shall be provided between non-party wall(1) developments.

All level differences within the covered walkways shall be mitigated with ramps and not steps. For covered linkways between developments, steps are only allowed for steep gradient where ramping is not possible. All ramps leading into the interior of the building shall begin outside the covered walkway.

Covered walkways shall be kept free from all obstructions. All building services and services which may cause obstruction when maintenance works are being carried out shall be located within the building.

## Platform Level of Covered Walkways

The platform level of covered walkways shall match the platform level of the open walkways.

- For open walkways that are at or to be raised to the Minimum Platform Level(1)

The covered walkways shall be built to the minimum platform level or other level stipulated by PUB so that they match the existing or proposed platform level of the open walkways.

Steps or ramps shall be provided to link to covered walkways in adjacent buildings which are not raised. The steps or ramps shall be levelled when the adjacent buildings are raised.

- For open walkways that are below the Minimum Platform Level

The covered walkways may be allowed below the minimum platform level or other level stipulated by PUB so that they match the existing platform level of the open walkways.

The first storey of the building shall be raised to the minimum platform level, with provision of steps or ramps for access.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).
