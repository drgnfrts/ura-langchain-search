# Provision of Open and Covered Public Walkways

All hotel developments shall provide covered walkways along the periphery of the building facing roads and pedestrian routes.

Covered walkways for hotel developments in the Central Area may be guided by urban design requirements. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

The specific urban design requirements for each planning area within the Central Area can be found on our [Urban Design](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) Website.

## Height of Covered Walkways

The soffit height of covered walkways is 3.6m.

Where higher ceiling height is desired, glass or other cladding may be provided at the edge of the covered walkway to achieve the 3.6m height.

A higher soffit height may be allowed in independent developments provided the walkway width is increased correspondingly to maintain the 45-degree angle, at main entrances to facilitate articulation, and on urban design grounds.

## Width of Covered Walkways

The minimum width for covered walkways varies depending on the location of the site and proximity to transport nodes. These are subject to urban design guidelines for selected locations with higher footfall eg Central Area, Regional Centres, and Key Growth Areas. For walkways wider than the minimum requirement, GFA exemption may be considered depending on merits of the proposal.
