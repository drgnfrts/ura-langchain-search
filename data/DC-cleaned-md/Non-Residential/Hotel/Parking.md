# Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area

In line with the planning intention to encourage the conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel, and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for the conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses (see examples in the table below) will be considered in selected areas where [CBD Incentive Scheme](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04) applies.

## Locality
### Areas where CBD Incentive Scheme applies
Only non-office uses will be allowed. Examples of possible non-office uses<sup>4</sup>:
a. Residential
b. Shops e.g. minimart, laundrette, hair salons, etc.
c. Clinics
d. Restaurants
e. Indoor farms
f. Gymnasium/Fitness centres
g. Childcare centres
h. Commercial schools
This is not an exhaustive list. Allowable uses will be subject to planning evaluation and will therefore vary from site to site.

---

For the rest of the Central Area, conversion of surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses is also highly encouraged, in line with the planning intention to inject more live-in population in the city.

## Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, hotel and mixed-use developments shall provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

# Parking

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses. **LTA may require the provision of coach parking bays in hotel developments.**

## Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle<sup>1</sup> parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

## Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

## Provision of Surplus Parking in New Developments

New hotel and mixed-use<sup>2</sup> developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, i.e., parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

If LTA approves the waiver, each surplus car parking lot shall be computed as 35sqm GFA, that being the average area of a car parking lot inclusive of circulation space. Each surplus motor-cycle parking lot shall be computed as 12sqm GFA.

## Conversion of Surplus Car Parking in Existing Developments

Existing hotel developments within the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB) or within 400m of MRT and LRT stations may be allowed to permanently convert their surplus car parking lots<sup>3</sup> to other uses.

Interested building owners are to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA before submitting a development application to URA.

We advise all building owners, developers, and QPs to refer to the [Loading Bay Design and Operations Best Practice Guide](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Jul/dc20-05---Guideline.pdf) when developing new commercial buildings or when redeveloping existing commercial buildings, especially for buildings with large retail components. 

This guide provides information, best practices, and recommendations regarding the design and operation of the loading bays within commercial buildings.
