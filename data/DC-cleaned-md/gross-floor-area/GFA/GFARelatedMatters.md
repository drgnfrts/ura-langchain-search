### GFA Related Matters



#### Computation to the Middle of External Walls



GFA is computed to the middle of external walls<sup>1</sup> (excluding the thickness of wall finishes). See illustration below.

Where there are windows or doors along the external wall, GFA is likewise computed to the middle of these windows or doors. See illustration below.

Where there are other vertical structures (e.g. railings, parapet walls, curtain walls) in-lieu of external walls, GFA will be computed to the middle of the outermost vertical structures. See examples below.

All Strata Areas to be computed as GFA



All proposed strata areas will be computed as GFA. For example, if an AC ledge serving a residential unit is included as part of the strata area of the unit, the AC ledge will be computed as GFA.



![Example of GFA and strata demarcation in AC ledge](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/77-GFA-Example-of-GFA-and-strata-demarcation-in-AC-ledge.jpg?h=500&w=800)



QPs are to clearly reflect both the GFA and strata boundaries on each of the floor plans submitted to URA, and to ensure all proposed strata areas have been duly computed as GFA. Non-provision of strata boundaries may result in a delay in URA’s grant of approval.



Developers are strongly encouraged to involve surveyors early in the design process to firm up the proposed strata boundaries. This is because any proposed changes to strata boundaries downstream may affect the resultant GFA of the development. If this results in the proposed GFA exceeding the Master Plan control, URA will require the proposed GFA to be rectified (e.g. via an amendment application) before strata subdivision approval can be granted.



**Exceptions where strata area need not be computed as GFA**



There are some developments (e.g. mixed-use developments) where spaces intended for public/ communal use are included as part of a larger strata area, for the purpose of demarcating ownership and maintenance responsibilities. For example, covered walkways on the 1<sup>st</sup> storey commercial floor, within a larger commercial/residential development or sky terraces on the upper hotel floor, within a larger hotel/office mixed-use development.



Such spaces can continue to be considered for GFA exemption (notwithstanding their inclusion as strata area), subject to compliance with URA’s prevailing guidelines for GFA exemptions.



#### GFA Apportionment



If the approved development comprises more than one use, the following rules shall apply in the calculation of common areas. Such a mixed development may also arise due to the land use zone, for example the Commercial & Residential zone.



**Attributable space:** Where a common area is exclusively used for a specific purpose, it will be apportioned to the specific use. See example below.



![Apportionment_Comm_2oct20](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72A-Apportionment_Comm_2oct20.jpg)



**Non-attributable space:** Where the common area is used for two or more purposes, it will be apportioned based on the weighted average, pegged to the prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning of the development. See example below.



**Master Plan Zoning**



- Residential with Commercial at 1st storey: 80% for Residential, 20% for Commercial

- Commercial & Residential: 60% for Residential, 40% for Commercial

- Hotel: 60% for Hotel, 40% for Commercial

- White: 100% for White

- Business Park: 85% for Business Park, 15% for White

- Business Park – White (X):

  - (100 – X)% for Business Park

  - X% for White

- Business 1 – White Z:

  - (Z) x 100% for Business 1

  - (Y - Z) x 100% for White

- *Common areas in White sites with a single use will be apportioned to that proposed use. For White sites with multiple uses, non-attributable common areas will be apportioned based on a simple average of the uses. The simple average apportionment of common area GFA on “white use” floors will similarly apply to the White components of Business Park, Business Park-White, and Business-White zones.*



The new apportionment rules will be applied on a per floor basis. If a floor is occupied by a single use (e.g. Commercial), any vertical circulation GFA areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned to Commercial use, though they may also be used by other users (e.g. Residential) above for escape purposes. However, if the floor is occupied by two or more uses<sup>1</sup> for which the staircase GFA on that floor cannot be exclusively attributed, they will be regarded as non-attributable space and apportioned based on a weighted average, pegged to the prescribed use quantum in the Master Plan zoning.



The illustrations above are not exhaustive in covering all possible building or layout designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA may, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into consideration and check with URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm the application of the rules on their proposals.
