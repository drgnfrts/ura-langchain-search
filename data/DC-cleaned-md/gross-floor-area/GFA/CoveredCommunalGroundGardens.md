# Covered Communal Ground Gardens

## Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) 
Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1<sup>st</sup> storey. Such gardens should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1<sup>st</sup> storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

### Secondary C2G2
Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be excluded from GFA up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The communal landscaped areas excluded from GFA within the 45-degree line must be unenclosed, accessible and contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

### Predominant C2G2
For Predominant C2G2, the additional covered areas beyond the 45-degree line may be considered for exclusion from GFA if the spaces provide substantial ground greenery with good spatial quality.

- The covered garden area should occupy at least 50% of the 1<sup>st</sup> storey building footprint;
- Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped while the remaining 40% shall be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds, and covered ornamental pools.

### Columns within 45-Degree Line
For scenarios where covered areas within the 45-degree line are excluded from GFA (e.g. Communal Covered Ground Garden and Sky Terraces), the area shadowed by columns are excluded from GFA.

If the column is excessively large (akin to a wall), the shadowed area shall be included as GFA. The 45-degree line for GFA exemption is not applicable in such an instance.
