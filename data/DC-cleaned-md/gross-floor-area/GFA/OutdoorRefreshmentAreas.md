### Singapore River Promenade

ORA located along Singapore River Promenade is computed as GFA. This ORA shall be confined to the boundary of the subject development and defined by markers, e.g. planters or flower pots. Only retractable awnings mounted on the development facades are allowed for the ORA to add more interest and diversity to the streetscape.

The full frontage of the development along the promenade and pedestrian mall can be considered for ORA uses, subject to detailed evaluation on the maximum allowable extent based on the existing site conditions and compliance with technical requirements. As the proposals sit on state land, applicants will have to obtain the Temporary Occupational License (TOL) from SLA or its appointed agent.
