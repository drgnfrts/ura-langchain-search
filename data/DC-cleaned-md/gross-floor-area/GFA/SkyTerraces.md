## Sky Terrace

The sky terrace area within the 45-degree line occupies equal to or more than 60% of the floor plate.

### Perimeter openness

- At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open and unenclosed.
- At least 60% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is open and unenclosed.
- Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to be considered open.

### Depth of Sky Terrace

The proposed depth of the sky terrace shall be minimally 5.0m throughout.

### Predominant Sky Terrace

- Sky terrace area as a percentage of floor plate: Not applicable.
- The sky terrace area within the 45-degree line occupies equal to or more than 60% of the floor plate.

### GFA exemption

- For sky terraces occupying less than 60% of the floor plate, the maximum area for GFA exemption of the sky terrace is defined by the area covered by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection.
- URA may grant additional GFA exemption for residual areas beyond the 45-degree line (capped at 20% of the floor plate area), if such areas form an integral part of the sky terrace or are part of the barrier-free/fire escape corridors.
- Corridors may be exempted from GFA computation for all sky terraces regardless of size based on certain criteria.

### Landscaping

Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. The planting shall be well externalised. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the usage of the sky terrace. As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds up to 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs. This facilitates compliance with FSSDâ€™s fire safety requirements on habitable space. The sky terraces shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

### Accessibility and Ownership

The sky terrace shall be accessible to all occupants of the building with communal access via a lift or staircase serving the sky terrace. Secondary access to the sky terrace from strata units can be supported. The sky terrace space is meant for communal use and is not treated as a privatised space. For sky terraces in residential developments that occupy less than 60% of the floor plates, the sky terraces shall serve a minimum of 2 strata units to ensure that they remain as communal space.

### Submission Requirements

A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for the sky terrace showing the proposed landscaping scheme, planting palette, soil depth, and communal facilities shall be submitted as part of the Development Application.
