# Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS)

1<sup>st</sup> storey covered public spaces may be excluded from GFA
under the Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS) scheme if they satisfy
the urban design, operational and eligibility requirements below.

## Parameters
Urban Design Guidelines

- The public space area should be large enough to improve the amenity of the local area and serve as a meaningful space for users. As a guide, the public space area should be at least:-
  - 1sqm of public space area for every 50sqm of total development GFA; or
  - 25% of the development's building footprint.

## Eligibility for GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space
To be eligible for GFA exemption, the first-storey covered public space should be within a development that is frequented by the general public and situated along popular pedestrian routes. These are typically: 

- Commercial developments/developments with significant commercial component (e.g. offices, business parks, shopping centres, hotels) or Civic & Community institutions and Educational institutions; and
- Located in Central Area, a Regional/Sub-Regional/Fringe Centre, a Growth Area (e.g. Tampines, Jurong East, Paya Lebar, Woodlands etc.)

## Extent of GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space
The GFA exemption applies to the entire covered area of the public space excluding Outdoor Refreshment Areas, if any.

Size
- The maximum allowable size for ORAs within POPS is up to 10% of the POPS area (see Fig.1);

Structure
- Designed as outdoor, unenclosed dining areas;
- Umbrellas, retractable canopies and lightweight structures are allowed;
- Only loose tables, chairs and approved structures by relevant authorities are allowed;
- All furniture or opaque structures should not exceed 1.2m high;
- The extent of the ORAs is to be clearly demarcated with boundary markers which are not easily removable e.g. planters. All structures and furniture, including menu stands, displays and signage, must not encroach beyond the extent of the approved ORA.

Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation
Outdoor kiosk for food preparation can be allowed within the ORA boundary if they comply with the following guidelines:-

- Ancillary food preparation area up to 30sqm.

Signage
Business names are allowed to be displayed on the awnings / structures. Any third-party advertisement signs or sponsor logos are not allowed as freestanding structures or to be displayed on the ORA structures. Any signs will require the written approval of Building and Construction Authority (BCA) prior to the installations.

Gross Floor Area
ORA within POPS will be considered as commercial GFA.

For developments which have maximised their development potential, the proposed ORA within POPS can be considered over and above the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan for the site, subject to the overall 10% GFA bonus cap for each development and the payment of Land Betterment Charge as assessed by SLA.

As per current practice, all additional GFA granted under the bonus GFA incentive schemes will not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The additional GFA granted under this scheme will not be transferable for other uses elsewhere in the development.
