</span># Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS)

1<sup>st</sup> storey covered public spaces may be excluded from GFA under the Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS) scheme if they satisfy the urban design, operational and eligibility requirements below.

## Urban Design Guidelines

### Size and Configuration

The public space area should be large enough to improve the amenity of the local area and serve as a meaningful space for users. As a guide, the public space area should be at least:

- 1sqm of public space area for every 50sqm of total development GFA; or
- 25% of the development's building footprint (whichever is lower).

Covered public spaces should have high volume of at least two storeys or an appropriate height in proportion to its size. At least 75% of the total public space area should consist of a contiguous space which is regular in shape, subject to detailed evaluation.

### Access and Location

The public space should be located at the first storey with a frontage onto a major street or pedestrian thoroughfare. The public space frontage should be open and unobstructed to allow for easy pedestrian access and be highly visible from the adjoining street or pedestrian thoroughfare. The access and circulation within the public space should be barrier-free and comply with BCA’s universal design guidelines.

### Public Seating and Amenities

Public seating should be provided. The minimum requirement is one seat per 20sqm of public space area (1m of bench/ledge = 2 seats). A variety of seating to cater to different users, age groups and physical abilities is encouraged, e.g. seats with back and arm rests are highly encouraged to cater to the elderly; movable seats to allow for interaction, etc.

The public space may include other amenities to encourage public use of the space such as:

- Design Features: Public Art, Water Features;
- Furniture + Equipment: Tables, Play/Exercise Equipment, Built-in Lighting and Audio Equipment for events; and
- Services: Drinking Fountains, Wi-Fi Connection, Phone Charging Points.

### Shade

The public space should be well shaded to encourage public use throughout the day. Shade can be provided by integration within the building form, by adjacent buildings, trees, canopies/pergolas, adjustable umbrellas/awnings, and/or landscape elements. The material used to provide shade must not result in additional heat retention in the public space.

Sun shadow study should be undertaken to demonstrate that sufficient shade is provided between 9:00am and 4:00pm. Shadow diagrams are to be studied for shadow cast on 21 Jun: at 9:00am, 12:00pm and 4:00pm. For each shadow diagram:

- At least 50% of the total public space area is to be shaded; and
- At least 50% of public space seating is be shaded.

### Signage

An information plaque shall be installed at a visible and fixed location near the main entrance of the public space. The plaque should include the following information:

- Public Open Space logo measuring at least 30 cm by 30 cm;
- “Open to public 24 hours” statement;
- Public space owner and their contact information.
- No smoking sign

Refer to [Annex 1-1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Jun/dc22-07-Annex-1-1.pdf) for the template file in PDF (editable in Adobe Illustrator) and high resolution logo image.

All text on the signage should be highly contrasting with the background colour of the sign, at least 20mm in height, and in a highly legible font. The signage must be constructed of highly durable material such as metal or stone that is fully opaque and non-reflective. The signage should be integrated with other signage in the same vicinity (if any), to reduce visual clutter.

## Operational Guidelines

The public space:

- Must be open to the public at all times;
- Cannot be enclosed and cannot be converted to any other permanent uses in the future; and
- Must remain as common property, in the event of strata subdivision.

ORA within POPS, if any, must remain as common property (i.e. as part of the public space), in the event of strata subdivision.

## Eligibility for GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space

To be eligible for GFA exemption, the first-storey covered public space should be within a development that is frequented by the general public and situated along popular pedestrian routes. These are typically:

- Commercial developments/developments with significant commercial component (e.g. offices, business parks, shopping centres, hotels) or Civic & Community institutions and Educational institutions; and
- Located in Central Area, a Regional/Sub-Regional/Fringe Centre, a Growth Area (e.g. Tampines, Jurong East, Paya Lebar, Woodlands etc.) or a Town Centre.

## Extent of GFA Exemption for First-Storey Covered Public Space

The GFA exemption applies to the entire covered area of the public space excluding Outdoor Refreshment Areas, if any.

## (Optional) Outdoor Refreshment Area within POPS

### Definition

An outdoor unenclosed seating area serving a Food & Beverage (F&B) unit.

### Use

Primarily used for seating. ORA seating is not to be counted towards the required POPS seating provision.

### Location

To be located within Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) of commercial or mixed-use developments. ORA within POPS should not impede pedestrian movement, obstruct fire engine access, safeguarded through-block links, view corridors and any other public open spaces.

### Height

Maximum 5m, single storey.

### Size

The maximum allowable size for ORAs within POPS is up to 10% of the POPS area (see Fig.1); The area of the ORA shall not be calculated as part of the minimum required size for POPS as stipulated in the Design Guidelines for POPS(1). The remaining area of the POPS after deducting the ORA should be equal to or larger than the minimum size required for POPS.

### Structure

- Designed as outdoor, unenclosed dining areas;
- Umbrellas, retractable canopies and lightweight structures are allowed;
- Only loose tables, chairs and approved structures by relevant authorities are allowed;
- All furniture or opaque structures should not exceed 1.2m high;
- The extent of the ORAs is to be clearly demarcated with boundary markers which are not easily removable e.g. planters. All structures and furniture, including menu stands, displays and signage, must not encroach beyond the extent of the approved ORA.

### Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation

Outdoor kiosk for food preparation can be allowed within the ORA boundary if they comply with the following guidelines:

- Ancillary food preparation area up to 30sqm. Larger food preparation areas may be considered on a case-by-case, subject to evaluation;
- No major food preparation is allowed;
- All furniture or opaque panels, including doors and internal partitions should not exceed 1.2m high;
- Up to 4m width, with an additional 1m return, of the lightweight structure (if any) can be walled with full height opaque panels to conceal equipment and storage. A wider width may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to evaluation;
- Designed as contiguous with the seating area;
- For proposals in which an ORA within POPS is integrated with an Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation, the combined seating area and the Outdoor Kiosk should not exceed 150sqm.

### Signage

Business names are allowed to be displayed on the awnings / structures. Any third-party advertisement signs or sponsor logos are not allowed as freestanding structures or to be displayed on the ORA structures. Any signs will require the written approval of Building and Construction Authority (BCA) prior to the installations.

### Gross Floor Area

ORA within POPS will be considered as commercial GFA. For developments which have maximised their development potential, the proposed ORA within POPS can be considered over and above the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan for the site, subject to the overall 10% GFA bonus cap<sup>[1]</sup> for each development and the payment of Land Betterment Charge as assessed by SLA.

As per current practice, all additional GFA granted under the bonus GFA incentive schemes will not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional GFA granted under this scheme will not be transferable for other uses elsewhere in the development.
