# Envelope Control Guidelines

Landed housing shall follow the envelope control guidelines introduced on 11 May 2015. These guidelines specify an allowable building envelope based on storey height and building setbacks. Development must not exceed the permissible building envelope as illustrated above.

**Building Height**

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is determined by the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may extend up to 1m beyond the allowable building height【4:1†source】.

## Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer limited to below 50% of a typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on the front facade. Houses with mezzanine floors must adhere to the permissible building envelope specified for the specific landed housing estate they are in【4:2†source】.

## Attics

Attics are incidental spaces permitted within certain envelopes. Roof terraces on attics must be positioned at least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope. Roofs with less than 3m clearance should be flat and inaccessible except for maintenance purposes【4:2†source】.

## Basements

### Basement Setbacks

- Basement with protrusion: Up to the road buffer for setback from Road Reserve Line and up to the building setback from other boundaries.
- Fully submerged basement: Up to the road reserve line, provided the section under the green buffer is at least 2m below ground level. The side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary must have no openings into the adjoining site【4:0†source】.

### Basements in Low-lying Areas

Internal areas below the Minimum Platform Level (MPL) on low-lying sites should be treated as a basement storey without counting towards additional storeys. Various requirements apply, such as sealing all internal areas below MPL with no external openings and complying with overall allowable height based on the Envelope Control guidelines【4:3†source】.

### Basements on Sloping Sites

Basement protrusions above the existing ground level on sloping sites must stay within the permissible Envelope Control building height to ensure compliance【4:3†source】.
