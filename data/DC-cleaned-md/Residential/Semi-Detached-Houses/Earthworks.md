# Earthworks

Earthworks may also be considered to:

- Create a vehicular access of maximum **4m** wide;
- Match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites.
- Create a workable platform level to mitigate level differences within an undulating or sloping site, or between the site and road.
- Facilitate building of a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback distances shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

## Minimum Platform Level (MPL)
The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

Earthworks within the buildable area (ie outside the building setback areas)

The proposed works shall be evaluated in relation to the permissible building envelope under the [Envelope Control guidelines](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/EC).

## Earthworks in low-lying areas

For low-lying sites that need to meet PUB’s minimum platform level (MPL):

- Only the building structures or internal living areas and setback areas from common boundaries shall be raised to meet the stipulated MPL.
- The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to the required MPL. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower than the existing ground level, whichever is higher.
- Any common retaining-cum-boundary walls or fences shall be designed sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of adjacent houses or land parcels.
- The following condition shall be annotated on plans: "*The Developer/Owner is fully aware that he shall raise the structures/areas built to lower platform levels, to or above the recommended Minimum Platform Level as and when the adjacent grounds/roads are raised in the future and comply with any other conditions deemed necessary by PUB*."

Refer to [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/EC) for more information on the treatment of internal areas below the MPL.
