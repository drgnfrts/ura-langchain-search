All structures shall generally be confined within the envelope. The car porch and patio/terrace area are subject to the setback guidelines shown in the [Building Setbacks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/Setbacks-from-boundaries) section.

### Car Porch

The height of the car porch shall not exceed 4.5m.

The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall remain open-to-sky and unenclosed.

The required setback for the accessible car porch roof area, when used as open balcony/garden from the common boundaries, shall follow the requisite side/rear setbacks of the main building.

Where one side of the car porch abuts the neighbourâ€™s boundary, a 1.8m high light-weight screen wall shall be built along the common boundary of the car porch roof to provide the neighbour with some privacy, unless the adjoining neighbour agrees to do without the screen wall. Examples of light-weight screens include angled louvres or slanted vertical panels.

Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:

- A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and railing);
- A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch roof;
- Planters for landscaping.

### Minor Building Appendages

While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.

Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks

| Main roof eaves(1)                                                                                                       | Into road buffer: 2m, Into common boundary setback: 1m                                  |
| Ledges or cantilevered awnings(2) (without vertical supports)                                                            | Into road buffer: 1m, Into common boundary setback: 1m                                  |
| Horizontal sun-shading devices, vertical sun-shading fins/ screens, other minor decorative features(3), planter boxes(4) | Into road buffer: 0.5m, Not to encroach into common boundary setback                    |
| Bay windows(5)                                                                                                           | Not to encroach into road buffer or common boundary setback                             |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Secondary roof eaves may only extend 1m beyond the permissible building envelope.
- (2): The maximum projection (i.e. 1m) into the road buffer or into the common boundary setback applies to retractable awnings when they are fully stretched out (i.e. not when the awnings are in their retracted positions).
- (3) Minor decorative feature examples: fins or light weight cantilevered screens spaced apart for sun-shading purpose without vertical supports. All such structural projections shall not exceed 500mm in depth.
- (4) Planter Boxes: cantilevered box structures for planting purposes.
- (5) Bay Windows: Raised windows not exceeding one structural bay width and cantilevered at least 0.5m high from the floor.
- If the plot abuts a GCBA plot, the minimum setback is 3m.
- These standards are based on Cat 3-5 roads. Setback requirement for other building features not covered under the table shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal.
