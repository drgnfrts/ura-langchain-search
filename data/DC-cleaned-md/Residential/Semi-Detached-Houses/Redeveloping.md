## Redeveloping to a Semi-Detached House

The illustrations apply to houses within Designated Landed Housing Areas (DLHAs). For proposals outside DLHAs, the left-behind plot must fulfil the minimum plot size requirement of 1,000 sqm.

A corner terrace house plot may be redeveloped into a new pair of semi-detached houses, provided:

- It can comply with the minimum plot width and size, and
- The adjoining terrace plot has 8m plot width and 200sqm plot size.

Any unit in a row of intermediate terrace houses may be redeveloped to a semi-detached house provided:

- The plot size and width are sufficient to allow the change, and
- The adjacent affected unit that the subject unit is detaching from, may be rebuilt into a corner terrace unit in the future (ie has a minimum plot size of 200sqm and width of 8m).

# Treatment of Existing Party Walls

The creation of a new blank party wall at the common boundary for a new house is generally not allowed.

For all redevelopments involving detachment from an existing unit, resulting in a bare and exposed party wall at the existing unit, the person undertaking the redevelopment shall do the following:

- Submit to the Building and Construction Authority, an engineerâ€™s certification of the structural stability of the remaining unit;
- Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house as soon as the existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished; and
- Allow the adjacent owner access to the site to maintain or repair the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house. This shall not be required if part of the party wall within the subject site is retained.

After the adjoining semi-detached house is redeveloped, the remaining semi-detached unit may remain as approved.
