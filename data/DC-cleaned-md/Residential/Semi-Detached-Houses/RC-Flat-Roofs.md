# RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls and the following guidelines.

- RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agenciesâ€™ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height and may be considered beyond the permissible building envelope.
- Height controls applicable include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
