### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

| Road Category                       | Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                          | Main building: 24m (incl. 5m green buffer)(@), Car Porch/Terrace/Patio: Maximum depth of the car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. |

![Road Buffer for Site with Multiple Units](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182b_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

In developing a site for multiple units of landed houses, the proposed developments on all the plots will need to observe the requisite road buffer from the road reserve line fronting the development boundary, even if the development site fronts two Category 5 roads. Requests for 2m side setback from any road frontage will be considered based on the merits of the proposal and the site context.

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (@): While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to Building Appendages section.
- (#): The 2.4m setback applies only to the 3m (maximum) car porch width (measured column to column). Beyond this 3m, other car porch setbacks shall follow the terrace/patio setback requirements. A wider car porch may be considered on the merits of the proposal.

### Setbacks from Common Boundaries

| Structure                                       | Minimum Setbacks                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main Building, Car Porch columns, Terrace/Patio | 2m (Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.)   |
| Roof Eaves (including car porch roof eaves)(1)  | 1m (Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.) |

Car Porch columns  
Terrace/Patio  
)
Roof Eaves (including car porch roof eaves) | 1m  
(_Note_: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.)

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to Building Appendages section.

### Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created plots)

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones), the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch where a minimum 2.4m setback is still required.

Setbacks for semi-detached houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots

![Setbacks for semi-detached houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD05_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an existing plot configuration and not newly created through subdivision,
- he an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

#### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

![Example of plot where reduced setback does not apply](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

The 1st storey rear extension of semi-detached houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes. Such back lanes (with widths of between 4 to 6m) would provide adequate setback between 2 rows of houses.

### Rear setback for semi-detached houses abutting existing back lanes

Rear setback for semi-detached houses abutting existing back lanes

![Rear setback for semi-detached houses abutting existing back lanes](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LH_Rear_Extensions_Abutting_Back_Lane.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

All such rear extensions shall comply with the following requirements:

- The height of the rear extension shall not exceed that of the floor-to-floor height of first storey.
- No structure or roof eave shall encroach the back lane.
- For houses abutting state owned back lanes, new door and window openings may be allowed at the walls or boundary walls abutting the back lanes.
- For houses abutting privately owned back lanes, existing door or window openings may remain, but they shall not be enlarged or shifted. New openings or enlargement of existing openings along privately owned back lanes shall not be allowed unless the applicant has prior written consent from the back lane owner.
- Any new openings, where allowed, shall open inwards.
- A planning condition may be imposed requiring the closure of any openings along the back lane, in the event the back lane is redeveloped.

### Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve(2) line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.22 MB), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.05 MB), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf) (PDF, 1.25 MB), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.15 MB), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf) (PDF, 1.18 MB), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part) (PDF, 134 KB), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.11 MB) and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.04 MB). All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg site coverage, envelope control guidelines) shall apply. Refer to the relevant street block plans for the existing estates above in the [Locational Criteria](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Semi-Detached-Houses/Locational-Criteria) section.

#### Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

|                       | From Road Reserve Line (Front Boundary)     | From Rear Boundary | From Side Boundary |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Main Building         | 3m                                          | 7.5m               | 2m                 |
| Car Porch             | 3m                                          | -                  | -                  |
| Covered Terrace/Patio | -                                           | 5.1m               | -                  |
| Roof Eaves            | 1m (applies to roof eaves of the main roof) | -                  | -                  |
