Category 3 & Category 4 / Slip Road | Main building: 7.5m (incl. 3m green buffer)  
Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m  
Terrace/Patio: 2.4m
Category 5 | Main building: 7.5m (no green buffer)  
Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m  
Terrace/Patio: 2.4m

### Setbacks from Common Boundaries

**Structure** | **Minimum Setbacks**

Sunken Swimming Pool | Category 1 – 4 road: Follow green buffer standards  
Category 5 road: None | None
Water Tank | Category 1 – 5 road: Follow road buffer standards | 2m  
(*Water tanks (without pumps) may abut boundary walls if its height does not exceed the boundary wall height of 1.8m (maximum)*)
Water Pump | Subject to evaluation | 2m
Letter Boxes | None | None
Meter Compartment | None | None
