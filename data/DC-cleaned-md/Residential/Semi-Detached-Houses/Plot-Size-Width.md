The plot size and width refers to the net dimension and area of the plot excluding the land required to be set aside for vesting to the State e.g. excluding Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR).

| Back-to-back semi-detached house                                      | 200sqm              | 10m                  |

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Refer to guidelines for [Terrace houses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace).

### Plot Width for Irregular Plots

For plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in the required plot width for semi-detached housing may be considered provided:

- The average width of the site remains at least 8m so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
- The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m;
- The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines eg setback, road buffer, etc.

Examples of irregular-shaped plots allowed

[![Examples of irregular-shaped plots allowed](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig176_Irregular-shaped_Plots_A.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig176_Irregular-shaped_Plots_A.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, shall be restricted to one plot per development and shall be a residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).
