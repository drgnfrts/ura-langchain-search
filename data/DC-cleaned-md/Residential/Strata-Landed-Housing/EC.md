# Envelope Control Guidelines
From 11 May 2015, landed housing is controlled by the envelope control guidelines. The guidelines define an allowable building envelope for each landed housing unit based on the landed housing type, setbacks, and storey height.

- The building footprint of each strata landed unit shall have a minimum ground contact of 50sqm.
- Each unit shall not exceed the permissible building envelope for its landed housing type.
- The building envelope is illustrated in the figures below.

For existing strata landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on a case-by-case basis.

### Building Height
Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height for each strata landed housing unit shall be based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height and allowable building height in metres.

- Strata landed housing shall not exceed the 2 or 3-storey height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the existing neighbourhood character.
- The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the two distinct platform levels.
- Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:
- Absolute technical height constraints (eg Aviation paths restrictions, military, and telecommunications installations).
- Conservation guidelines available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB)
- Urban design height controls available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB)

The absolute technical height (based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any other height controls.

### Mezzanine Floors
Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept below 50% of a typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on the front facade of the mezzanine floors. Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate it is located in (ie maximum 12m overall height for a designated two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5m for a designated three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential living.

### Attics
An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively.

### Basements
Basements may be built up to the limits shown in the table below.

**Basement Setbacks**

#### Basement with Protrusion
- Setback from Road Reserve Line: Up to the road buffer
- Setback from other Boundaries: Up to the building setback

#### Fully Submerged Basement
- Setback from Road Reserve Line: Up to the road reserve line, provided the portion underneath the green buffer is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level
- Setback from other Boundaries:
  - For plots outside GCBA: Up to the site lot boundary, provided:
    - The portion underneath the 2m tree planting strip is submerged at least 2m or more below the ground level
    - There are no technical requirements (eg sewerage, drainage), and the basement does not cause any adverse impact to the adjoining property
    - The side of a basement wall abutting any site boundary shall not have any openings into the adjoining site.
  - For plots within GCBA: Fully submerged basements shall be setback 2m from the boundary lines.

**Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
