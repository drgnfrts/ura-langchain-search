# Vehicular Access and Parking

## Vehicular Access

Vehicular access to any strata unit within the development shall be taken only from the common driveway.

Individual strata units shall not have direct vehicular access from public roads.

## Car Park Provision

The overall car park provision for the development shall comply with LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS). If the car parking lots are counted towards the unit’s strata area (i.e. private car parking lots), they will be computed as GFA. These shall be contiguous with the respective strata unit.
