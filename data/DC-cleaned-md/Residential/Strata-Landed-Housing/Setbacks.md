# Building Setback from Boundary

### Road Buffer and Green Buffer

The building setback controls of strata landed housing developments from public roads shall be determined by the road buffer as shown in the table below. Where the strata landed housing development site fronts two or more public roads, the buffer requirements from the roads shall be applied to all boundaries fronting roads.

### Common Boundaries Setback and Planting Strip

Any strata unit within the development site shall be set back 3m (minimum) from the common site boundary with another development.

A wider setback shall be required for 3-storey strata landed housing sharing a common boundary with Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA).

### Minor Building Appendages

**Maximum allowable protrusion into road buffer and common boundary setbacks**

- **Electric Substation**
    - **Category 1 & 2 roads**: 5m
    - **Category 3 – 5 roads**: 3m within GCBA: 3m within GCBA or with GCBA plots: 3m
- **Sunken Swimming Pool**: Not applicable
- **Raised Swimming Pool**: Follow road buffer standards
- **Water Tank & Pump**
- **Meter Compartment**: Subject to evaluation If these are located within the green buffer or tree planting strip: 1.8m
- **Bin Point**
- **Guardhouse**: If this is located within the green buffer or tree planting strip: 2.6m
- **Generator Set**: Subject to evaluation Adequate setback may have to be provided to minimize glare and noise disturbance to adjoining developments【4:0†source】.
