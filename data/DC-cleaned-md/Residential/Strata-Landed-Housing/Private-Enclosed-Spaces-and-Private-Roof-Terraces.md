# Private Enclosed Spaces and Private Roof Terraces

## Private Enclosed Spaces

A Private Enclosed Space refers to a semi-outdoor area adjacent to a strata unit and it forms part of the private strata area of units which are sold to homeowners. All PES in new strata landed submitted on or after 1 June 2023 will be computed as GFA. PES in strata landed submitted before 1 June 2023 will not be computed towards the development’s GFA.

### Guidelines for Private Enclosed Spaces

#### Location

PES shall not be located within the 45% communal open spaces, 2m planting strips and green buffers, as the covers would add to the bulk and massing of the house.

#### Covers

- Full covers (subject to compliance with SCDF’s requirements) over the entire PES may be allowed provided they comply with development control parameters such as building setback and site coverage. PES covers shall be approved upfront as part of the Development Application process. Developers may propose a single cover design, or a few designs for the homeowners to choose from.
- Developers shall install a 2m wide (minimum) cover from the external wall. Homeowners shall be given the flexibility and choice over the remaining cover for the rest of the PES beyond 2m, as long as it is one of the approved designs and provided they obtain MCST clearance prior to installation. MCSTs may use these pre-approved designs to guide homeowners who wish to extend their cover beyond 2m.

#### Fencing

- PES shall be physically demarcated from common areas. Any PES fencing that defines the extent of the PES shall not exceed 1m in height. This is to ensure the open and semi-outdoor nature of the PES is maintained.
- A 1.8m screen wall may be proposed between PES adjoining each other for privacy purposes.

## Private Roof Terrace

A Private Roof Terrace refers to a semi-outdoor area located at the roof level of a strata unit and it forms part of the private strata area of units which are sold to homeowners. All PRT in new strata landed submitted on or after 1 June 2023 will be computed as GFA. PRT in a strata landed submitted before 1 June 2023 will not be computed towards the development's GFA. These should be clearly annotated as "Private Roof Terraces'.

### Guidelines for Private Roof Terraces

#### Location

PRT may be allowed on the flat roof or attic of the strata landed house, if they are located at least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building envelope.

#### Covers

- Covers (subject to compliance with SCDF’s requirements) may be allowed on PRT so long as they are within the maximum permissible Envelope Control height and the covers shall generally not exceed the permissible Envelope Control profile of each individual strata landed units (see [Envelope Control section](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing/EC) for more details).
- Such covers shall be approved upfront as part of the development application process. Developers may propose a single cover design, or a few designs for the homeowners to choose from.
- Installation of the covers is optional. Homeowners may choose from one of the approved designs, should they wish to cover the PRT subsequently. Homeowners shall obtain MCST clearance prior to installation. MCSTs may use the pre-approved designs to guide homeowners who wish to install covers.
