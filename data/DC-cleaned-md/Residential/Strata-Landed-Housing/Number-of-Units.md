The cap on the number of allowable units in strata landed housing developments shall be based on the typical footprint of the conventional landed housing form used and the development's location.

The formulae to compute the maximum number of allowable units in the various types of strata landed housing developments are shown in the table below.

### Formulae for computing maximum number of strata landed units

#### Location of Strata Landed Housing Developments
Within GCBAs  
35% of site area / Y2
Where **Y2** = Typical footprint for a Good Class Bungalow (500sqm)

Outside GCBAs (single form of landed housing)  
40% of site area / Y1
Where **Y1** = Typical footprint for the relevant conventional landed housing form, as follows:
- Other Bungalows: 200sqm
- Terrace and Semi-Detached housing: 100sqm

Outside GCBAs (mix of landed housing form eg a mix of terrace, semi-detached and detached housing units  
(B × Y) + (SD × Y1) + (T × Y1) ≤ 40% of site area
Where:
**B** = Number of detached housing units
**SD** = Number of semi-detached housing units
**T** = Number of terrace housing units
**Y1** = Typical footprint for the relevant conventional landed housing form

## Gross Floor Area (Individual Units)

The gross floor area for each individual strata landed housing unit is the resultant of the building form and envelope.
