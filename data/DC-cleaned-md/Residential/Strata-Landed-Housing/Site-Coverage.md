## Site Coverage and Communal Open Space

For strata landed housing developments outside Good Class Bungalow Areas, the maximum site coverage is 50%. For strata landed housing developments within Good Class Bungalow Areas, the maximum site coverage is 40%.

## Communal Open Spaces

To safeguard the living environment of strata landed developments, a minimum of 45% of the nett site area<sup>1</sup> of the strata landed housing development shall be set aside for Communal Open Space (COS).

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> The nett site area shall exclude land to be set aside for road widening & drainage reserve.</span>

### Examples of COS

**Examples of spaces that qualify as COS:** Recreational facilities that are uncovered and raised no more than 1m above ground level such as: 
- Exercise equipment and structures in fitness areas;
- Game courts for tennis, basketball etc;
- Swimming pool; wading pool.

**Examples of spaces that do not qualify as COS:** Buildings and other ancillary structures (e.g., substations) that are already computed as site coverage.

Structures that form part of landscaping features such as:
- Art sculptures;
- Fountains.
  
Driveways and parking lots do not qualify as COS.

Fire-engine hard-standing ground/access and other service areas are not considered part of COS.

Voids at ground level overlooking basements are included under COS.

Of the 45% COS, at least 25% (as a percentage of the site area) shall be set aside for communal on-ground greenery.

Areas classified as COS shall not be included in the boundary of the individual strata plots. For instance, the 2m planting strips and green buffers that are part of the minimum 45% COS provision shall not contain any Private Enclosed Spaces (PES).
