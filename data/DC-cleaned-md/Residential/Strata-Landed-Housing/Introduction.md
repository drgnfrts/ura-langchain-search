## Strata Landed Housing Development

A strata landed housing comprises strata-titled landed housing units occupying a common development site with shared communal facilities and a single vehicular access point.

Any of the following three basic types of landed housing form can be built as strata landed housing:

- Strata bungalows (detached houses);
- Strata semi-detached houses (houses defined by their partial attachment on one side to another unit);
- Strata terrace houses (houses that are attached along a common boundary party wall and are part of a row of at least three units).

A strata landed development site may have a mix of bungalows, semi-detached houses, and terrace houses occupying a common development site with shared communal facilities and a single vehicular access point. The building footprint of each strata landed unit shall have a minimum ground contact of 50sqm. All other requirements are guided by the envelope control guidelines and respective parameters for the relevant landed housing type.

Strata landed houses may be allowed within a flats development site. *Such hybrid developments are not accorded condominium status*. They are not allowed in designated landed housing areas.

The number of strata landed housing units allowable depends on the type of landed housing forms proposed apart from a minimum communal open space provision requirement. This is to safeguard amenity for strata landed housing residents and maintain compatibility of the strata landed housing development with surrounding landed housing estates.
