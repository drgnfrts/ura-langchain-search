The building setback requirements for bungalow developments are as follows:

## Road Buffer and Green Buffer

| Road Category                       | Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets) - GCBA                                                                                                                          | Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets) - Other Bungalows                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1                          | Main building: 24m (incl. 5m green buffer)(@), Terrace/Patio, Car Porch: Maximum depth of the terrace/patio or car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. | Main building: 24m (incl. 5m green buffer)(@), Terrace/Patio, Car Porch: Maximum depth of the terrace/patio or car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. |
| Category 2                          | Main building: 12m (incl. 5m green buffer)(@), Terrace/Patio, Car Porch: Maximum depth of the terrace/patio or car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. | Main building: 12m (incl. 5m green buffer)(@), Terrace/Patio, Car Porch: Maximum depth of the terrace/patio or car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. |
| Category 3 & Category 4 / Slip Road | Main building: 7.5m (incl. 3m green buffer)(@), Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m(#), Terrace/Patio: 5.1m                                                                         | Main building: 7.5m (incl. 3m green buffer)(@), Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m(#), Terrace/Patio: 2.4m                                                                         |
| Category 5                          | Main building: 7.5m (no need for green buffer)(@), Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m(#), Terrace/Patio: 5.1m                                                                      | Main building: 7.5m (no need for green buffer)(@), Car Porch [to outermost roof eave line]: 2.4m(#), Terrace/Patio: 2.4m                                                                      |

(@) While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Building-Appendages) section.

(#) The 2.4m setback applies only to the 3m (maximum) car porch width (measured column to column). Beyond this 3m, other car porch setbacks shall follow the terrace/patio setback requirements. A wider car porch may be considered on the merits of the proposal.

## Setbacks from Common Boundaries

| Structure                                       | GCBA | Outside GCBA                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main Building, Car Porch columns, Terrace/Patio | 3m   | 2m, Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.   |
| Roof Eaves (including car porch roof eaves)(1)  | 1.6m | 1m, Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA. |

(1) While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Building-Appendages) section.

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

## Setbacks for an existing individual plot outside GCBA with more than one road frontage

For an individual plot with more than one road frontage, the building setback requirements are shown in the figures below.

Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Non-Cat 5 roads)

![Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Non-Cat 5 roads)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD05_Setbacks_Multiple_Road_Frontages.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Cat 5 roads)

![Setbacks for a bungalow with more than 1 road frontage (Cat 5 roads)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD06_Setbacks_Multiple_Cat_5_Roads.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

## Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created) outside GCBA

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones) outside GCBA, the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch which requires a 2.4m setback.

![Setbacks for irregular/odd-shaped plots outside GCBA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD07_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an already existing plot configuration; not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

![https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

## Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve(2) line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.22 MB), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf) (PDF, 1.05 MB), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf) (PDF, 1.25 MB), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.15 MB), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf) (PDF, 1.18 MB), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part) (PDF, 134 KB), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.11 MB) and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf) (PDF, 1.04 MB).

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks

|                       | From Road Reserve Line (Front Boundary)     | From Rear Boundary | From Side Boundary |

| Car Porch             | 3m                                          | -                  | -                  |
| Covered Terrace/Patio | -                                           | 5.1m               | -                  |
| Roof Eaves            | 1m (applies to roof eaves of the main roof) | -                  | -                  |
