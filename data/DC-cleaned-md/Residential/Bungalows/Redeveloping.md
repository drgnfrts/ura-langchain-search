The illustrations apply to houses within Designated Landed Housing Areas (DLHAs). For proposals outside DLHAs, the left-behind plot must fulfil the minimum plot size requirement of 1,000 sqm.

## Redevelopment Critera outside GCBA

Outside GCBA, the redevelopment of other housing forms to Bungalows may be considered under the following conditions:

### From a Semi-detached to a Bungalow

- It complies with the minimum plot size of 400sqm and plot width of 10m, and
- The left behind (or remaining) semi-detached unit is capable of being redeveloped into a new bungalow in the future (minimum plot size of 400sqm, plot width of 10m).

### From a Terrace House to a Bungalow

- It complies with the minimum plot width of 10m and plot size of 400sqm, and
- The adjoining terrace house qualifies to become a new corner terrace unit in future (minimum plot size of 200sqm and plot width of 8m)
