# Redeveloping to a Bungalow

The illustrations apply to houses within Designated Landed Housing Areas (DLHAs). For proposals outside DLHAs, the left-behind plot must fulfil the minimum plot size requirement of 1,000 sqm.

Outside GCBA, the redevelopment of other housing forms to Bungalows may be considered under the following conditions:

## From a Semi-detached to a Bungalow
It complies with the minimum plot size of 400sqm and plot width of 10m, and
The left behind (or remaining) semi-detached unit is capable of being redeveloped into a new bungalow in the future (minimum plot size of 400sqm, plot width of 10m).

## From a Terrace House to a Bungalow
It complies with the minimum plot width of 10m and plot size of 400sqm, and
The adjoining terrace house qualifies to become a new corner terrace unit in the future (minimum plot size of 200sqm and plot width of 8m)

- not more than 1 newly created plot is deficient in plot size after vesting of land; and
- the deviation from minimum plot size shall not be more than 10%.

# Redevelopment of Existing Semi-detached House to Bungalow or Semi-detached House

## Not Allowed
The left-behind Plot A is not large enough for a standard bungalow. House B shall not be allowed to break away and be redeveloped into a bungalow.
