# Plot Size and Width for Bungalows

The plot size and width refers to the net dimension and area of the plot excluding the land required to be set aside for vesting to the State e.g. excluding Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR).

## Guidelines for Plot Size and Width

### Bungalows (Within GCBA)

- **Location**
  - Bungalows (Within GCBA)
- **Plot Size (Minimum)**
  - 1,400sqm
- **Plot Width (Minimum)**
  - 18.5m
- **Plot Depth (Minimum)**
  - 30m

### 

## Bungalows (within GCBA) - Variations in plot dimensions

Variations in plot width, depth and size may be considered under the following circumstances.

- The proposed development site is an in-fill development on an existing plot which is already deficient in plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm).   
- For proposals arising from amalgamation and subdivision of GCBA lots, only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (ie less than 1,400sqm) shall be allowed per amalgamation and subdivision proposal. The shortfall in the deficient plot size shall be due to vesting of land for public purpose (eg for road widening), and the shortfall in that plot size shall be less than 10%. All proposed new bungalows shall comply with the requisite site coverage and building setback requirements for GCBs.
- For proposals arising from a subdivision of GCBA lots containing conserved bungalows, the plot sizes of the new plot and the conserved bungalow plot shall be at least 2,800sqm (after setting aside for road widening/drainage reserve<sup>1</sup>, etc). Only one new residual plot with deficient plot size (less than 1,400sqm) of not less than 1,000sqm shall be allowed per conserved bungalow.

### Examples of irregular-shaped plots allowed

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, is restricted to one new plot per development provided it is a new residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).
