## Retaining Walls

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

- Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are impractical.
- Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate greenery effect, if fronting a road or street.

## Boundary Walls

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m high.

The combined height of the retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (e.g., fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.
