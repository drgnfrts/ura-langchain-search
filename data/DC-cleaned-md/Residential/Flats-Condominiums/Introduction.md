# Introduction

## Flats and Condominiums

Flats and condominiums are non-landed residential developments approved for dwelling purpose. Each residential unit shall have a satisfactory layout for residential purpose comprising bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, and toilets.

### Zones and Approvals

Flats and condominiums are allowed in areas zoned Residential, Commercial & Residential, Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey, White, and Residential/Institution (in the Geylang Planning Area) in the Master Plan. They are not allowed in areas designated only for landed housing developments, except for existing flats and condominiums previously approved in such areas. The residential component within a mixed-use development will be approved as flats and will not be accorded condominium status.

### Condominiums vs. Flats

Condominiums typically offer more generous provision of communal and recreational facilities than flats developments and have larger [Site Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Site-Area) and more [Common Boundary Setback](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Setback).

For sites zoned Commercial/Residential or Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey, refer to the [Commercial Handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial) for the relevant guidelines.
