# Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area

In line with the planning intention to encourage conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel, and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses will be considered in selected areas where [CBD Incentive Scheme](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04) applies.

## Locality  
Allowable Change-of-Use for Surplus Carparks  
- **Areas where CBD Incentive Scheme applies**  
  Only non-office uses will be allowed. Examples of possible non-office uses:  
    a. Residential  
    b. Shops e.g. minimart, laundrette, hair salons, etc.  
    c. Clinics  
    d. Restaurants  
    e. Indoor farms  
    f. Gymnasium /Fitness centres  
    g. Childcare centres  
    h. Commercial schools  
    This is not an exhaustive list. Allowable uses will be subject to planning evaluation and will therefore vary from site to site.

## Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, residential developments shall provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property. If the bicycle parking lots are counted towards the unit strata area (i.e. private bicycle parking lots), they will be computed as GFA.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

# Parking

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

## Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property. If the car or motorcycle parking lots are counted towards the unit’s strata area (i.e. private car parking lots), they will be computed as GFA.

### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

### Provision of Surplus Parking in New Developments

New residential and mixed use developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, i.e., parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

If LTA approves the waiver, each surplus car parking lot shall be computed as 35sqm GFA, that being the average area of a car parking lot inclusive of circulation space. Each surplus motor-cycle parking lot shall be computed as 12sqm GFA.

Additional GFA arising from the surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

*Note: Mixed use developments are developments with commercial and/or hotel components that form more than 20% of the total GFA. The above guidelines shall apply to mixed use developments within the Central Area or within 400m of MRT and LRT stations.*

### Conversion of Surplus Car Parking in Existing Developments

Existing residential developments within the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB) or within 400m of MRT and LRT stations may be allowed to permanently convert their surplus car parking lots.

1. With the RPPS, surplus car parking lots in existing developments may arise if the upper bound for the development type is revised downward and/or if developments choose to reduce car parking provision to the lower bound set out by the RPPS.

LTA may consider conversion of carparks up to the lower bound as stipulated in the RPPS. Interested building owners are to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA before submitting a development application to URA.

The conversion of surplus car park may be allowed subject to compliance with ALL of the following:
- The proposed uses shall be in line with the Master Plan zoning for the site and the planning intention for the surrounding area. The detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
- The existing infrastructure and traffic network shall be able to support the increase in GFA and uses, and take into consideration proposed measures to mitigate traffic generation.
- The resultant car parking provision shall be able to support the additional GFA and proposed uses.
- Additional GFA arising from the conversion may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. The additional GFA arising from the conversion of surplus car parking, detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
- Requests for conversion of surplus car parks may not be supported for sites where there are specific conditions imposed in planning approval or the government land sale that restrict the conversion of the surplus car parking spaces, or sites located within or adjacent to Conservation Areas where additional car parking spaces are needed to support the uses within the conserved buildings.

Additional GFA gained via the conversion of surplus car parking spaces shall not be taken into consideration in determining the maximum permissible intensity that may be allowed for the re-development of the site.

Where surplus car parking spaces were allowed by LTA through a waiver application to exceed the upper bound of the Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS) after 1 Feb 2019, the development will not be allowed to convert any of the surplus car parking spaces to other uses.
