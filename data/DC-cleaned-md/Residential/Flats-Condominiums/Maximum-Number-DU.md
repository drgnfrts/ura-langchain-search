### Guidelines on Dwelling Units (DU) in Non-Landed Residential Developments

The following sections detail the formulae to determine the maximum number of dwelling units (DUs) for a development, as well as the required mix of DU sizes to cater to the needs of different buyers (e.g. larger families). These requirements do not apply to HDB flats and Serviced Apartments.

#### For flats and condominiums within the Central Area

**Maximum number of DUs**

There is no cap on the maximum number of DUs within the Central Area (see [Map 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB)). This is because new developments within the Central Area are less likely to put a strain on local infrastructure, as the area is generally well-served by public transport with residents less reliant on private vehicles.

**Mix of DUs**

All flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments shall provide a minimum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area of at least 70 sqm.

The following sections detail the formulae to determine the maximum number of dwelling units (DUs) for a development, as well as the required mix of DU sizes to cater to the needs of different buyers (e.g. larger families). These requirements do not apply to HDB flats and Serviced Apartments.

#### For flats and condominiums outside the Central Area

**Maximum number of DUs**

The formula for calculating the maximum allowable number of DUs is intended to derive an upper bound figure. The actual number of DUs that may be supported in any development shall be assessed based on the site context, existing site conditions, and the impact on the local infrastructure. URA shall assess the overall layout, design, and unit sizes of the residential development proposals, and may add other requirements where necessary to protect the quality of the living environment.

The following formula applies to all flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments (e.g. Residential with Commercial at 1st storey or mixed commercial and residential developments), except those in the Central Area (see [Map 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB) and [Maps 2-10](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_2.pdf) (PDF, 1.92 MB):

The following formula applies to all flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments within the estates in Maps 2-10, due to the potential strain on local infrastructure from the cumulative effect of new developments in these areas:

**Mix of DUs**

Each development shall provide:
- A minimum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area of at least 100 sqm
- A maximum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area of 50 sqm or less
