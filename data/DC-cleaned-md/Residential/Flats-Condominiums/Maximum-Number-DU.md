### Introduction

The following sections detail the formulae to determine the maximum number of dwelling units (DUs) for a development, as well as the required mix of DU sizes to cater to the needs of different buyers (e.g. larger families). These requirements do not apply to HDB flats and Serviced Apartments.

As a guide, all self-contained DUs island-wide shall be at least 35sqm nett(1) in internal area.

(1): Refers to nett living space of a unit excluding voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges and other external areas.

### Flats and Condominiums Outside the Central Area

#### Maximum number of DUs

The formula for calculating the maximum allowable number of DUs is intended to derive an upper bound figure. The actual number of DUs that may be supported in any development shall be assessed based on the site context, existing site conditions and the impact on the local infrastructure. URA shall assess the overall layout, design and unit sizes of the residential development proposals, and may add other requirements where necessary to protect the quality of the living environment.

The following formula applies to all flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments (e.g. Residential with Commercial at 1st storey or mixed commercial and residential developments), except those in the Central Area (see [Map 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB)) and [Maps 2-10](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_2.pdf) (PDF, 1.92 MB):

The following formula applies to all flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments within the estates in [Maps 2-10](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_2.pdf) (PDF, 1.92 MB), due to the potential strain on local infrastructure from the cumulative effect of new developments in these areas.

#### Mix of DUs

Each development shall provide:

- A minimum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area(4) of at least 100 sqm
- A maximum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area(4) of 50 sqm or less

(2): Excludes bonus GFA (i.e., if the proposal is a mixed development, only the proposed GFA for the residential component shall be used in the calculation, excluding bonus GFA).

(3): The GFA of any proposed strata landed units shall be excluded from the calculation in the formula.

(4): Refers to nett living space of a unit excluding voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges and other external areas.

### For flats and condominiums within the Central Area

#### Maximum number of DUs

There is no cap on the maximum number of DUs within the Central Area (see [Map 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map_1.pdf) (PDF, 1.02 MB)). This is because new developments within the Central Area are less likely to put a strain on local infrastructure, as the area is generally well-served by public transport with residents less reliant on private vehicles.

#### Mix of DUs

All flats and condominiums and residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments shall provide a minimum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area(4) of at least 70 sqm.

(4): Refers to nett living space of a unit excluding voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges and other external areas.
