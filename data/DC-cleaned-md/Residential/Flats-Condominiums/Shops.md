# Ancillary Shops

## Limitations for Shops in Residential Developments

A limited number of units for shops to provide personal services may be allowed in flats and condominium developments subject to evaluation based on the following considerations:

- the scale of the development as reflected in the total gross floor area;
- the location of the site in relation to the main road;
- the character of the surrounding developments; and
- the planning intention of the surrounding area.

Up to 0.3% of the proposed residential gross floor area (excluding bonus balcony GFA, if any) may be proposed for shops. For example, flats and condominium developments with a proposed residential GFA of 20,000sqm may have up to 60sqm of shop GFA subject to the following conditions:

- The total permissible GPR and GFA shall include the above-mentioned shop GFA.
- Only personal service trades may be allowed (e.g. mini-marts/laundromats). Independent offices are not allowed.
