# Balconies, Private Enclosed Spaces, Private Roof Terraces and Indoor Recreation Spaces

## Balconies

The GFA of balconies in flats and condominium developments may be computed over and above the Master Plan (MP) allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 7% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.

Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 7% of the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height or use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master Plan, Building Height Plan or Special and Detailed Control Plan. For instance, a flats development within a designated landed housing area shall not qualify for the bonus balcony GFA.

To qualify for the additional GPR only for use as a balcony, the balcony designs shall adhere to the following guidelines and submission requirements:

### Guidelines for Balconies

- **Location**: Balconies shall be located away from M&E areas to safeguard the quality and usability of these spaces.
- **Openness**: Balconies shall have a continuous perimeter opening of at least 40%.
  - [Balcony Perimeter Opening](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F07_Balcony_Perimeter_Opening.jpg)
  - *The portions of a balcony that face a parapet wall (e.g., a wall between the balconies of two adjoining units) not exceeding 1.3m in height are considered “open”. The QP shall show the computation of perimeter opening for the proposed balconies on the floor plans.*
- **Size**: Total balcony size for each dwelling unit is capped at 15% of the internal nett unit size. This excludes voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges, and other external areas.
- **Width**: Balconies shall have a minimum width of 1.5m as measured from the external building wall. Exceptions to the width requirement may be considered arising from the design merit of the proposal, such as a curved or odd-shaped balcony, but the balcony shall be of a reasonable size.
- **Access**: Balconies with exclusive access from the kitchen/yard/utility space are treated as service balconies and do not qualify for bonus GFA. Balconies that serve as the only access into a dwelling unit do not qualify for bonus GFA.
- **Screen**:
  - Balconies shall not be enclosed with walls or glass panels as balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. Blinds are akin to furnishing and can be allowed at balconies without planning permission from URA.
  - Balcony screens (e.g., in the form of vertical fins, louvered panels) may be allowed provided:
    - The balcony screens can be drawn open or retracted fully.
    - The balcony screens allow for natural ventilation/air flow within the balcony at all times, even when the screens are fully drawn closed.
  - See diagrams below for some possible designs of balcony screens:

Balcony screens shall be designed upfront and approved as part of the Development Application process for all new residential developments with proposed balconies (including the residential component of mixed-use developments).

### Private Enclosed Spaces (PES)

Covers shall be approved upfront as part of the Development Application process. Developers may propose a single cover design or a few designs for the homeowners to choose from.

Developers shall install a 2m wide (minimum) cover from the external wall. Homeowners shall be given the flexibility and choice over the remaining cover for the rest of the PES beyond 2m, as long as it is one of the approved designs and provided they obtain MCST clearance prior to installation. MCSTs may use these pre-approved designs to guide homeowners who wish to extend their cover beyond 2m.

#### Setback
The PES cover shall be located outside the setback line, as the covers would add to the bulk and massing of the building.

#### PES Fencing
Any PES fencing that defines the extent of the PES shall not exceed 1m in height. This is to ensure the open and semi-outdoor nature of the PES. A 1.8m screening wall may be proposed between PES adjoining each other for privacy purposes. Full-height separating walls between adjoining PES may be allowed if they are to meet FSSD’s requirements.

### Private Roof Terraces (PRT)

A Private Roof Terrace refers to a semi-outdoor area located at the roof level of a strata unit. It forms part of the private strata area of units that are sold to homeowners. To avoid complications at the strata-subdivision stage, these should be clearly annotated as ‘Private Roof Terraces’.

All PRT of developments shall be counted as GFA under the 7% maximum bonus GFA allowed beyond the Master Plan (MP) stipulated GPR. PRT approved before 12 January 2013 may not be counted towards the development’s GFA.

To qualify for the bonus GFA scheme, PRT shall comply with the guidelines to retain a semi-outdoor character. The structures shall comply with the relevant requirements from technical agencies.

### Guidelines for Roof Terraces

#### Location
Private roof terraces may be allowed on the flat roof of a building. Private roof terraces shall not be allowed on top of the attic level.

#### Covers
Coverings (subject to compliance with SCDF’s requirements) may be allowed on PRT provided the development complies with the applicable storey height controls. Such covers shall be approved upfront as part of the development application process. Developers may propose a single cover design or a few designs for the homeowners to choose from.

#### Height Control
- If the storey height control has been maxed out:
  - Any covers on the roof terrace floor shall be setback according to the 45-degree envelope taken from the springing line1. The structures shall not exceed 5m at any point, subject to the technical height controls, where applicable.
- If the storey height control has not been maxed out:
  - The roof terrace shall be taken to be an additional storey. Covers may be allowed over the entire roof terrace floor. The overall height of the development shall comply with the technical height controls, where applicable.

#### Structures within Private Roof Terraces
To retain the open and semi-outdoor nature of the RT, any structures shall remain open-sided as viewed from the external façade.
