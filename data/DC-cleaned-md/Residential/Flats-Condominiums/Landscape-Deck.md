# Landscape Deck

To encourage greenery and to conceal car park spaces, developments may provide landscape decks that double up as car parks. These may be ground level, or partially sunken car parks which are decked over with greenery and communal facilities and partially covered with earthfill.

*Deck Treatment for Landscape Deck*

A landscape deck may be provided if the site meets the following parameters:

- Minimum site area of 4,000sqm;
- GPR above 1.4 in the Master Plan;
- Not within existing landed housing areas or abutting landed housing areas.

The above parameters are to ensure that the site is sufficiently large for a landscape deck without affecting the amenity of the neighbouring developments, and to safeguard the low-rise character of landed housing areas.

## Guidelines for Landscape Deck

### Envelope
No deck structures within the planting strips/green buffers.
Deck structures shall be contained within a 1:2.5 gradient envelope.

### Height Cap
If the landscape deck exceeds 5m in height as measured from the platform level, it shall be counted as an additional storey and subject to site coverage control.

### Storey Height Definition/Basement Protrusion
- At least 50% of each fa√ßade of the basement wall area may be covered either by:
  - Earth-berms/earthfills. The gradient of the earth-berms/earthfills shall be less than or equal to 1:2.5 and lushly landscaped (not just turfed only).
  **OR**
  - Vertical greening on the exposed blank wall. The greenery shall be well distributed, and the 50% shall be computed based on the elevation plan. If the intention is for the landscape deck to be naturally ventilated, measures shall be taken (e.g. physical brackets, fins) to confine the vertical greenery within the spaces set aside for the greenery.
- Earthfill may be allowed within the planting strip/green buffers to raise the landscape deck height, up to a height of 5m from the platform level.
- Openings (basement access points/ventilation openings) and/or hard surfaces of the basement wall (untreated with vertical green) shall not exceed 50% (maximum) of the basement wall area.

### Greenery Provision
- At least 30% (minimum) of the deck surfaces shall be provided with greenery.
- The soil depth shall be at least 500mm for planting purposes.
- Artificial turf, water features, including water bodies with water plants shall be excluded from the 30% greenery provision.

### Boundary Wall
The boundary abutting the Landscape Deck shall have porous fencing, as opposed to full height solid boundary walls. Where it is necessary to comply with PUB surface water drainage purposes, the boundary wall may consist of a solid 0.6m high wall followed by a porous 1.2m high fencing. This is to ensure that the landscaping is visible on all facades from the street level.
