# Building Height

The overall building height for flats and condominiums shall be determined by the number of storeys and the prescribed floor-to-floor height.

## Number of Storeys

For sites zoned Residential only, the number of storeys for flats and condominium developments shall be guided by the GPR as shown in the following table:

**GPR** | **Maximum Number of Storeys**
--- | ---
1.4 | 5
1.6 | 12
2.1 | 24
2.8 | 36
More than 2.8 | More than 36

Basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

The maximum no. of storeys may differ for the areas which:

1. Have street block controls (refer to [Street Block Plans](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Street-Block-Plans));
2. Have technical height controls (refer to [Building Height Plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=BH) in URA SPACE);
3. Have conservation or urban design requirements;
4. Have security considerations;
5. Do not conform to the typical GPRs shown above, eg GPR 2.9, GPR 1.7;
6. Are located in the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (see map below), where there are current height restrictions to protect the visual amenity of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

## Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate. Such floors may be allowed a floor-to-floor height of 5.0m. If the sky terrace occupies less than 60% of the floor plate, the floor-to-floor height shall comply with a 3.6m floor-to-floor height.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, flats and condominiums with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

**Proposed Storey Height of Development** | **Additional Building Height Allowed**
--- | ---
7 - 20 | 10.0m
21 - 30 | 15.0m
31 - 40 | 20.0m
41 - 50 | 25.0m
More than 50 | 30.0m

Both the 5.0m floor-to-floor height for PSTS and the additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

1. Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
2. Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3. Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) â€“ (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.

## Floor-to-Floor Height & Aggregate Building Height

In addition to the number of storeys control, the individual storeys shall be guided by the prescribed floor-to-floor height as shown in the table below.
