# Building Setback from Boundary

![Illustration of Setback and Buffer](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F04_Road_Buffer_and_Setback.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Flats and condominiums shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve<sup>1</sup> line or boundary line to the external wall of the flats, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

The setback for flats and condominiums from public roads are determined by the road buffer, which is dependent on the category of the road that the site fronts and the height of development. For roads that are not categorised, the minimum road buffer of 7.5m applies. A green buffer shall also be set aside within the road buffer. The classification of the road category may be obtained from LTA’s Road Interpretation Plan (RIP).

The type of road buffer & setback are shown in the diagram above, and are detailed in Tables 1 & 2.

Bay windows, ledges, roof eaves and other minor building features may encroach into the setback distance up to the extent shown in Table 3 below.

Exceptions to the setback and buffer requirements are listed below:

- Sites with street block controls (refer to the [Street Block Plans](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Street-Block-Plans) section);
- Party-wall<sup>3</sup> developments (to be assessed upon formal submission of a proposed development);
- Flats and condominium developments within the River Valley, Newton and Orchard Planning Areas. The standard road buffer for these shall be 7.5m (of which 3m is green buffer);
- Flats and condominium developments in the [Central Area](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map.pdf) (PDF, 436 KB) other than those in the River Valley, Newton and Orchard Planning Areas. The required road buffer shall be based on urban design considerations.

<sup>1</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

_Note_: A 2m-wide (minimum) planting strip is to be provided along all common boundaries of the development site.

\*Roof terrace(s), if proposed, shall be orientated to face away from the GCBA

## Building Setback for Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCP)

### Setback from Road

**Note**: The road buffer for MSCPs facing a Category 3-5 road and slip road is based on the predominant use of the development. This is to achieve a consistent streetscape along these smaller roads.
