# Serviced Apartments

Serviced Apartments (SA) are self-contained apartments with kitchenettes/kitchens, and typically provide support services such as concierge, common dining areas, housekeeping and/or laundry for the residents.

SA units shall meet a minimum unit size of 35 sqm (nett). For proposals with design merits or specific concepts, URA would consider applying the 35 sqm minimum unit size based on the global average of self-contained units (with kitchenette and toilet) and covered communal facilities exclusively for SA tenants' use(1).

SA shall be rented out for lodging purposes for a minimum period of 7 days or longer, and shall be developed and/or managed under one ownership. Strata subdivision of SA is strictly not allowed.

Support services such as concierge, housekeeping and/or laundry provided for the residents of Serviced Apartments may be allowed. In addition, limited bar/lounge facilities may be permitted, subject to a maximum of 0.3% of the total residential GFA.

SA may be allowed in Residential zones and may also be considered on mixed-use sites where residential uses are allowed.

## Definitions and Notes

- (1): The following areas would generally be excluded from being considered as covered communal facilities exclusively for co-living tenants' use:
  - Public areas or facilities not exclusive to co-living tenants (e.g. communal areas that double as public cafes, public co-working offices)
  - Functional and circulation spaces (e.g. concierge/check-in areas, back-of-house, corridors)
  - Open-to-sky areas (e.g. open roof terraces)

## SA within Residential zones (incl. mixed use sites with a residential component)

Applicants may submit an Outline Application to URA to determine the suitability of the location, the Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) control and the storey height for a proposed SA.

SA may be allowed where the site fronts a major or arterial road (i.e. Category 1, 2, 3 roads or equivalent) at the fringe of a residential area; or the site is located in a mixed-use area (e.g. commercial centres, business parks, or abutting medical hubs).

SA shall not be allowed within the designated Landed Housing Areas; areas where SA may potentially cause dis-amenities to the neighbouring residents; and areas where there are already dis-amenities in the surroundings (examples of such areas can be found under the [Hotels Handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Hotel)).

## SA within mixed-use areas

SA may be considered in mixed-use areas and are not restricted by the category of roads fronting the site.
