### Envelope Control Guidelines

From 11 May 2015, all landed housing shall follow the envelope control guidelines which define an allowable building envelope based on storey height and building setbacks. The development shall not exceed the permissible building envelope as illustrated in the figure above.

For existing landed housing approved under previous landed housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works should comply with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of the proposal.

**Building Height**

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height and allowable building height in metres.

- Landed housing shall not exceed the 2-storey or 3-storey height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the existing neighbourhood character.
- The allowable building height is measured from the external platform level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the two distinct platform levels.
- Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:
- Absolute technical height constraints (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
- Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

The absolute technical height (based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any other height controls.
