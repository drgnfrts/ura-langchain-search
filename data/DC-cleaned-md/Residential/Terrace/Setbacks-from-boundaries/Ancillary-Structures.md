# Building Setback from Boundary

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/TH02_Setbacks_Terrace_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

**Road Buffer and Green Buffer**

### Road Category
- Terrace Type I
- Terrace Type II

| Road Category | Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets) |  
| --- | --- |  
| Category 1 | Main building: 24m (incl. 5m green buffer)<sup>@</sup> Car Porch/Terrace/Patio: Maximum depth of the car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. 2m |  
| Category 2 | Main building: 12m (incl. 5m green buffer)<sup>@</sup> Car Porch/Terrace/Patio: Maximum depth of the car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m. 2m |  
| Category 3 & Category 4 / Slip Road | Main building: 7.5m (incl.)*  

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

### Rear Setback for Terrace Houses Abutting Existing Back Lanes

The 1st storey rear extension of terrace houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes. Such back lanes (with widths of between 4 to 6m) would provide adequate setback between 2 rows of houses.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LH_Rear_Extensions_Abutting_Back_Lane.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

**Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes**

All such rear extensions shall comply with the following requirements:
- The height of the rear extension shall not exceed that of the floor-to-floor height of the first storey.
- No structure or roof eave shall encroach into the back lane.
- For houses abutting state owned back lanes, new door and window openings may be allowed at the walls or boundary walls abutting the back lanes.
- For houses abutting privately owned back lanes, existing door or window openings may remain, but they shall not be enlarged or shifted. New openings or enlargement of existing openings along privately owned back lanes shall not be allowed unless the applicant has prior written consent from the back lane owner.
- Any new openings, where allowed, shall open inwards.
- A planning condition may be imposed requiring the closure of any openings along the back lane, in the event the back lane is redeveloped.

### Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve² line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout.

**Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks**

| | From Road Reserve Line (Front Boundary) | From Rear Boundary | From Side Boundary |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| Main Building | 3m | 7.5m | 2m |  
| Car Porch | 3m | - | - |  
| Covered Terrace/Patio | - | 5.1m | - |  
| Roof Eaves | 1m (applies to roof eaves of the main roof) | - | - |

*Setback Requirements for Rear Garden Landed Housing*

All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg envelope control height) shall apply.

² **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures shall adhere to the required setbacks as shown in the table below.

***Refer to*** [Ancillary Structures](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries/Ancillary-Structures) ***sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures***

### Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created plots)

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones), the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch where a minimum 2.4m setback is required.

*Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots*

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:
- It is an existing plot configuration and not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

### Rear Setback for Terrace Houses Abutting Existing Back Lanes

The 1st storey rear extension of terrace houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes.

**Requests for 2m side setback from any road frontage will be considered based on the merits of the proposal and the site context.**

### Setbacks from Common Boundaries

| Structure | Terrace Type I | Terrace Type II |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Building Car Porch columns Terrace/Patio | Main building: 2m Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA. | 2m Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA. |
| Roof Eaves (including car porch roof eaves)¹ | Roof eaves*: 1m Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA. | 1m Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA. |

¹ While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. ***Refer to*** [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) ***section.***
