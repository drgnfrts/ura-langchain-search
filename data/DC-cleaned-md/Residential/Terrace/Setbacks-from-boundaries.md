# Building Setback from Boundary

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/TH02_Setbacks_Terrace_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

## Road Buffer and Green Buffer

**Road Category**

- Category 1:
  - Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): Terrace Type I - Main building: 24m (incl. 5m green buffer)<sup>@</sup> Car Porch/Terrace/Patio: Maximum depth of the car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m.
  - Terrace Type II: 2m

- Category 2:
  - Road Buffer (Inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets): Terrace Type I - Main building: 12m (incl. 5m green buffer) Car Porch/Terrace/Patio: Maximum depth of the car porch [to outermost roof eave line] protruding into the road buffer is 5m.
  - Terrace Type II: 2m

- Category 3 & Category 4 / Slip Road:
  - Main building: 7.5m (incl.

Refer to [Ancillary Structures](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries/Ancillary-Structures) section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

## Rear Setback for Terrace Houses Abutting Existing Back Lanes

The 1<sup>st</sup> storey rear extension of terrace houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes. Such back lanes (with widths of between 4 to 6m) would provide adequate setback between 2 rows of houses.

*Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes*



## Rear Garden Landed Housing

“Rear garden” landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve<sup>2</sup> line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout.

Requests for
2m side setback from any road frontage will be considered based on the merits of the proposal and the site context.

Refer to [Ancillary Structures](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries/Ancillary-Structures)Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building appendages into the setback areas.

## Setbacks from Common Boundaries

### Structure

- Main Building, Car Porch columns, Terrace/Patio:
  - Terrace Type I: Main building: 2m Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.
  - Terrace Type II: 2m Note: The 3m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.

- Roof Eaves (including car porch roof eaves)<sup>1</sup>:
  - Terrace Type I: Roof eaves*: 1m Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.
  - Terrace Type II: 1m Note: The 1.6m GCBA common boundary setback requirements shall apply if the plot abuts a GCBA.

<sup>1</sup> While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to Building Appendages section.


All other relevant
landed housing guidelines (eg site coverage, envelope control
guidelines) shall apply. Refer to the relevant street block plans for
the existing estates above in the Locational Criteria section.

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

### Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks

|                 | From Road Reserve Line (Front Boundary) | From Rear Boundary | From Side Boundary |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Main Building   | 3m                                       | 7.5m               | 2m                 |
| Car Porch       | 3m                                       | -                  | -                  |
| Covered Terrace/Patio | -                                | 5.1m               | -                  |
| Roof Eaves      | 1m (applies to roof eaves of the main roof) | -             | -                  |

*Setback Requirements for Rear Garden Landed Housing*


All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg envelope control
height) shall apply.

**Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

## Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures shall adhere to the required setbacks as shown in
the table below.

Refer to Building Appendages section.

## Irregular-Odd-Shaped-Plots

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly
created ones), the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall
apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the
adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback
may be allowed, except for the car porch where a minimum 2.4m setback is
required.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD05_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg>

*Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots*

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an existing plot configuration and not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or
5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout
after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply
