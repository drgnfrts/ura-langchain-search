## Road Buffer and Green Buffer

In developing a site for multiple units of landed houses, the proposed developments on all the plots will need to observe the requisite road buffer from the road reserve line fronting the development boundary, even if the development site fronts two Category 5 roads. Requests for 2m side setback from any road frontage will be considered based on the merits of the proposal and the site context.

Refer to Ancillary Structures sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC[) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building features into the setback areas.

### Notes and Definitions:

- (@): While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section.
- (#): The 2.4m setback applies only to the 3m (maximum) car porch width (measured column to column). Beyond this 3m, other car porch setbacks shall follow the terrace/patio setback requirements. A wider car porch may be considered on the merits of the proposal.

Refer to [Ancillary Structures](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries/Ancillary-Structures) sub-section for the setback requirement for minor structures, [Basements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/EC) section for basement setbacks, and [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section for allowable encroachment of minor building appendages into the setback areas.

### Notes and Definitions

- (1): While the roof eaves may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context. Refer to [Building Appendages](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Building-Appendages) section.

## Setbacks for existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created plots)

For already existing irregular or odd-shaped plots (excluding newly created ones), the standard 7.5m building setback from a road shall apply for a width of 8m, measured from the common boundary line with the adjoining neighbour. Beyond the 8m width, a reduced 2m building setback may be allowed, except for the car porch where a minimum 2.4m setback is required.

Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots

![Setbacks for corner terrace houses on irregular or odd-shaped plots](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD05_Setbacks_Odd_Shaped_Plots.jpg)

A plot is deemed irregular or odd-shaped if:

- It is an existing plot configuration and not newly created through subdivision,
- The an odd-shaped site is fronting a minor road (ie category 4 or 5),
- The resultant building footprint cannot achieve a meaningful layout after complying with the standard 7.5m road buffer requirement.

### Examples where Reduced Setbacks do not apply

![Example Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Redevelopment/LH_Fig182a_Redevelopment_NA.jpg)

B1 & B2 are newly created constrained plots. Such new subdivisions are not eligible to apply the reduced front setback guideline.

## Rear Setback for Terrace Houses Abutting Existing Back Lanes

The 1st storey rear extension of terrace houses may be allowed to abut existing back lanes. Such back lanes (with widths of between 4 to 6m) would provide adequate setback between 2 rows of houses.

Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes

![Rear setback for terrace houses abutting existing back lanes](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LH_Rear_Extensions_Abutting_Back_Lane.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

All such rear extensions shall comply with the following requirements:

- The height of the rear extension shall not exceed that of the floor-to-floor height of first storey.
- No structure or roof eave shall encroach into the back lane.
- For houses abutting state owned back lanes, new door and window openings may be allowed at the walls or boundary walls abutting the back lanes.
- For houses abutting privately owned back lanes, existing door or window openings may remain, but they shall not be enlarged or shifted. New openings or enlargement of existing openings along privately owned back lanes shall not be allowed unless the applicant has prior written consent from the back lane owner.
- Any new openings, where allowed, shall open inwards.
- A planning condition may be imposed requiring the closure of any openings along the back lane, in the event the back lane is redeveloped.

## Rear Garden Landed Housing

"Rear garden" landed housing allows for a larger garden at the rear, with a narrower setback from the road. This orientation is a reversal of conventional guidelines which require landed housing developments to be setback 7.5m from the road reserve line. Houses with rear gardens shall be sited within their own enclave, and segregated from the rest of the estate with their own access road.

Rear garden landed housing may be allowed within new landed housing enclaves that are designated for such a layout. Otherwise, the guidelines are generally applicable within the existing estates of [Hong Leong Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Hong-Leong-Garden-Estate.pdf), [Clementi Green Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Clementi-Green-Estate.pdf), [Changi Heights](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Changi-Heights.pdf), [Lasia Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Lasia-Avenue.pdf), [Peach Garden](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Peach-Garden.pdf), [The Inglewood](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Nov/dc18-10/dc18-10-Annex-1.pdf) (part), [Ford Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Ford-Avenue.pdf), and [Yuk Tong Avenue](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Street-Block-Plans/Yuk-Tong-Avenue.pdf). All other relevant landed housing guidelines (eg site coverage, envelope control guidelines) shall apply. Refer to the relevant street block plans for the existing estates above in the Locational Criteria section.

The setback controls for Rear Garden housing are as follows:

Rear Garden Landed Housing Setbacks

|                       | From Road Reserve Line (Front Boundary)     | From Rear Boundary | From Side Boundary |

| Covered Terrace/Patio | -                                           | 5.1m               | -                  |
| Roof Eaves            | 1m (applies to roof eaves of the main roof) | -                  | -                  |
