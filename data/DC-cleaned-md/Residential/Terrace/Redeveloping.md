The left-behind Plot D has sufficient plot size and plot width for a corner terrace house. House E may redevelop into a bungalow or a pair of semi-detached house.

Owner of House E shall be required to comply with the following conditions:

1. Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof of the remaining house as soon as the existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished;
2. Allow the owner of the adjacent house access to the subject site to maintain or repair the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining house; and

The left-behind Plot D does not have sufficient plot size and plot width for a corner terrace house. House E shall not be allowed to redevelop into a bungalow.

## Treatment of Existing Party Walls

The creation of a new blank party wall at the common boundary upon redevelopment is generally not allowed.

For all redevelopments that involve detaching from an existing unit, resulting in a bare and exposed party wall at the existing unit, the person undertaking the redevelopment shall do the following:

- Submit to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), an engineer’s certification of the structural stability of the remaining unit;
- Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house as soon as the existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished; and
- Allow the adjacent owner access to the site to maintain or repair the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house. This is not required if part of the party wall within the subject site is retained.

After the adjoining unit is redeveloped, the remaining terrace unit may remain as approved.
