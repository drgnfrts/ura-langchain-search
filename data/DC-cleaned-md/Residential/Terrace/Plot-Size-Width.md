## Plot Width for Irregular Plots

For corner or intermediate terrace plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in plot width may be considered provided:
- The average width of the site remains at least 8m for a corner terrace plot, and 6m for an intermediate terrace plot, so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
- The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m;
- The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines e.g. setback, road buffer, etc.
The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, shall be restricted to one residual plot per development (i.e. all other plots within the same multi-unit development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).
