### Guidelines for Allowable Uses

#### Guidelines on Showroom

Showroom in industrial premises are meant primarily for the display of two categories of products as follows:

- Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the counter (eg bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle).
- Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (eg floor tiles)
- Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and when the prospective end-user or business operator for the showroom space is known.

Showroom may be considered subject to the following:

- Showroom shall be confined to the 1st storey of the development.
- SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Guidelines on Ancillary Display Area

An ancillary display area is meant only for the display of products related to the predominant industrial operations in the development.

Ancillary display area may be considered subject to the following conditions:

- Displayed products are purely for corporate or demonstration purposes that serve corporate customers of the industrial companies only and not open to public;
- These products cannot be sold on-the-premises or on site;
- There shall be no strata-subdivision or sub-leasing of these areas; and
- Endorsement from relevant agencies (eg HDB & JTC for leased premises; EDB & ESG for private premises) may be required.

SLA may assess such ancillary display areas based on Group D Industrial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

##### Conversion of Previously-Approved Ancillary Showroom

If an existing industrial development has a previously approved ancillary showroom (now re-termed Display Area), the owner or operator of such ancillary showroom may apply for planning permission to convert it to a showroom in accordance with the showroom definition and guideline stated above.

Alternatively, the previously approved ancillary showroom may be expanded to function as an enlarged ancillary display area in accordance with the current definition for ancillary display area and guideline stated above.

The table below shows what can or cannot be done to a previously approved ancillary showroom.

| Previously Approved Ancillary Showroom (Now re-termed Display Area) | What Can or Cannot Be Done                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

- The total GFA of these commercial facilities shall not exceed 200sqm or 10% of the total GFA of the development, whichever is lower.
- SLA may assess such commercial uses based on Group A Commercial rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### Guidelines on Temporary Workers' Dormitory

Workers' dormitory are premises used to house migrant workers who are engaged to carry out industrial or production or construction activities. Dormitories may comprise new extensions to existing buildings or new building blocks within an industrial development or may be converted from existing spaces within an industrial development.

New workers' dormitories located outside specified areas (refer to Table 1 and 2 below) or renewal of existing dormitories may be considered on Temporary Permission (TP) for up to 5 years subject to compliance with prevailing guidelines and the use not causing disamenities.

To provide more temporary housing options for migrant workers while additional purpose-built dormitories are being constructed, URA and technical agencies will now assess applications for (i) new temporary workers' dormitories and (ii) increase in the number of workers in existing dormitories located within the specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1 below) on individual basis. If supported, the use will be on 3-years TP, and may not be renewed subsequently.

Note: The following guidelines are for workers' dormitories located within industrial developments. Independent workers' dormitories located separately from the industrial development may be allowed only on land zoned Civic and Community Institution. Click [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/WD) for Guidelines for independent workers' dormitories.

##### Types of Temporary Workers' Dormitories

- Ancillary dormitories may house only workers employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development and workers who work on-site in the subject development.
- Secondary dormitories may house workers not employed by the owner or lessee of the industrial development as well as workers who work on- and off-site.

##### Location

- All new proposed workers' dormitories or increase in capacity within industrial developments are assessed on the merits of the case.
- New applications located within 13 specified industrial areas (refer to Table 1) will only be considered if the proposals meet prevailing guidelines, and can be supported by existing infrastructure as assessed by technical agencies. Please refer to the circular dated 10 Feb 2023 for more information.
- Prior clearances from NEA, PUB, SCDF, and LTA shall be obtained before a proposal is submitted to URA for evaluation.
- New workers' dormitories shall not fall within NEA and SCDF's health and safety buffer zones, sub-areas reviewed by PUB where there are existing sewer capacity constraints or specified areas listed in Table 2 below.
- Workers' dormitories are not allowed within the Central Area and on land zoned Business Park/Business Park-White.
- For multi-user industrial developments, new workers' dormitories shall be located within a separate building within the site. They are not allowed within the same building as other industrial units.

### Vertical Openings

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

- While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (i.e., the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
- The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
- Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
- The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
- Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Earthworks
date: 5 July 2019
---

### Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

Location of Allowable Earthworks:

![Location of Allowable Earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Earthworks within the Building Setback Area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in specific circumstances:

- When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
- When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
- When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the Build-able Area (i.e. outside the Building Setback Area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the Entire Development Site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)(1).

##### Definitions and Notes:

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

### Retaining & Boundary Walls

Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls:
![Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet specific requirements:

- The height shall be less than 1.5m;
- Retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
- The total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.

### Specific Earthworks and Retaining Wall Guidelines for Industrial Developments

The above are general guidelines for earthworks and retaining walls. For industrial developments, these guidelines will apply differently depending on the type of development on the neighbouring parcels of land.

Earthworks for industrial scenarios where the guidelines apply:

![Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/-/media/52700266ABC24FD5A07E3FFA0FA3A7D0.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Earthworks for industrial scenarios where the guidelines do not apply:

1. Where the boundary is shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park, the existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply.
2. Where the boundary is not shared with an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park, the existing earthworks guidelines and controls on retaining and boundary walls shall apply.
3. Where the boundary abuts a public road, the existing controls on earthworks, retaining, and boundary walls shall apply. Earthworks guidelines shall not apply if the development beyond the public road is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park.
4. Where the boundary abuts a drainage reserve, the existing controls on retaining and boundary walls shall not apply. Earthworks guidelines shall not apply only if the development beyond the drainage reserve is an industrial development (B1/B2) or a business park. If the development beyond the drainage reserve is not an industrial development or business park, the earthworks guidelines shall apply.



## Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Business 2 are:

### Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA(1). Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

| Land Use        | Development Type                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Residential(2)  | Condominium and Flats development                                                                                                                             |
| Non-Residential | Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments |
| Mixed Use       | Combination of the above                                                                                                                                      |

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.
- (2): The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme(3). The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (3): Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

title: Gross Plot Ratio
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/GPR
date: 5 July 2019
---

The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a B2 development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). This upper bound GPR may not always be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve(1) and/or Road Reserve(2) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

GPR for sites where vesting is required

![GPR for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Drainage Reserve: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.
- (2) Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### B2-White

B2 sites located next to MRT stations may be zoned B2-W. The white component is to provide flexibility for industrial companies in such locations to accommodate synergistic White uses.

For such B2-W sites, a minimum GPR shall be achieved for the permissible B2 uses first. This minimum GPR for B2 uses is indicated in the square brackets on the Master Plan.

For example, in the map below, the site next to Joo Koon MRT Station is zoned "**2.5 \[B-2.0\] W**". A B2-W site would have an overall allowable GPR of 2.5. A minimum GPR of 2.0 must be achieved and used for industrial purposes before the remaining GPR 0.5 may be unlocked for White uses.

Refer to the section on [Allowable Uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Allowable-Uses) for the list of allowable uses within the White component.

Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses, telecommunication, and utility buildings. These developments may be allowed on land zoned Business 1 (B1) or Business 2 (B2).

Depending on the nature of their activities, clean and light industries are allowed in Business 1 (B1) zone. General and special industries are to be located in Business 2 (B2) zone.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 100m nuisance buffer from a B2 zone to the surrounding area. The allowable types of industry or use within industrial developments in B2 zone, based on NEA’s nuisance buffer requirements, are listed [here](https://e-services.nea.gov.sg/ias/PublicApplicant/Homepage.aspx).



## Parking
---
title: Parking
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Parking
date: 28 June 2023
---

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

### Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle(1) parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

Range-based Parking Provision Standards

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

New B2 developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

#### Private Parking Lots

Within multi-user developments, industrial strata units may be allowed to have their own private car/lorry parking lots subject to the following:

- The private parking lots are surplus parking lots over and above LTA’s minimum parking provision;
- The floor area of the private parking lots shall be computed as GFA under the 40% ancillary quantum of each strata-unit;
- The private parking lots are physically contiguous to the industrial strata unit.

For approved private car/lorry parking areas that were previously not computed as GFA, they may be converted to other allowable usable areas subject to the following:

- These areas are computed as GFA and the resultant GFA does not exceed the current MP GPR Control for the development site;
- The proposed conversion is authorized by the MCST via a 90% resolution;
- The remaining number of parking lots after conversion still meets LTA’s minimum parking provision;
- SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

### Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, B2 developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments.

Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

### Introduction

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only(1). Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls(2) and the following guidelines.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies’ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.
- (2): Height controls applicable, include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- (@): The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

- Maximum 500sqm(1) or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
- For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
- For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
- Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
- Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
- A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

- a. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
- b. The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

- a. **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas(2) shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.**

- b. **Elevated solar panels(3) located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**
  - Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
  - Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
  - Mixed Commercial & Residential
  - Commercial
  - Hotel
  - White
  - Residential / Institution
  - Commercial / Institution
  - Educational Institution
