#### Definitions and Notes

- (1) **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Vertical Openings

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

- While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (i.e., the earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).
- The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
- Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the basement is not allowed.
- The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the other technical departments.
- Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

### Floor-to-Floor Height

The maximum floor-to-floor height of C&CI developments is 5.0m.

### Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

![Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C04_Additional_Height_for_Sky_Terrace_Floors.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7 storeys, C&CI developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table below:

Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height

| Proposed Storey Height of Development | Additional Building Height Allowed |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 7- 20                                 | 10.0m                              |
| 21 - 30                               | 15.0m                              |
| 31 - 40                               | 20.0m                              |
| 41 - 50                               | 25.0m                              |
| More than 50                          | 30.0m                              |

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

- a. Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National Monuments;
- b. Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
- c. Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in [urban design areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with site-specific height considerations.



## Community Centres or Community Clubs

title: Community Centres or Community Clubs
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/CC
date: 5 July 2019
---

Community centres or community clubs are developed and managed by the People’s Association (PA). They may be free-standing or independent developments or co-located with other public service facilities like public libraries, neighbourhood police centres.

Other private clubs are zoned Sports & Recreation in the Master Plan – see their guidelines under the tab [Sports & Recreation](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/SR).

#### Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The minimum GPR for community centres or community clubs is 1.4.

The allowable gross plot ratio and number of storeys for community centres or community clubs shall take into account the character of the surrounding area.

The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

#### Use Quantum

Ancillary commercial quantum up to 20% of the total building GFA may be provided in community centres or community clubs managed by the PA. The actual commercial quantum allowable is subject to planning consideration depending on the location, site condition, site context, impact on the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies.



## Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls

title: Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/Earthworks
date: 5 July 2019
---

### Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain, land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary, shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are carried out.

Location of Allowable Earthworks:

![Location of Allowable Earthworks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C07_Earthworks.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

#### Earthworks within the Building Setback Area

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except in specific circumstances:

- When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;
- When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site and the road;
- When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement. The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### Earthworks within the Build-able Area (i.e. outside the Building Setback Area)

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform level.

#### Earthworks within the Entire Development Site

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum Platform Level (MPL)(1).

##### Definitions and Notes:

- (1) Minimum Platform Level (MPL): The minimum 1st storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

### Retaining & Boundary Walls

Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls:
![Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F15_Retaining_Wall_15m.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed, they shall meet specific requirements:

- The height shall be less than 1.5m;
- Retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site constraints and the need for extensive excavation;
- The total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries (except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land to the same MPL.



## Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Civic and Community Institution are:

### Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of the development proposal.

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition & Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA(1). Sites launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as follows:

| Land Use        | Development Type                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Residential(2)  | Condominium and Flats development                                                                                                                             |
| Non-Residential | Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments |
| Mixed Use       | Combination of the above                                                                                                                                      |

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the developers.
- (2): The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme(3). The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (3): Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA’s grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment. The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from BCA’s grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation form](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf). The submission process and verification of ITM outcomes is summarised at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-Submission-process.pdf).

#### Requirements on ITM Outcomes for Bonus BE Transformation GFA

The guideline on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for new Civic and Community Institution (C&CI) developments shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. The allowable GPR in the table below is the upper bound. The actual allowable GPR would depend on site conditions, traffic situation, impact of the C&CI development on the nearby developments and other agencies’ requirements.

### Allowable Gross Plot Ratio

| Location                                                                                                           | Gross Plot Ratio Control                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Within landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4                                     | Up to 1.0                                        |
| At the fringe of landed and low-density housing areas with GPR less than or equal to 1.4                           | Up to 1.0                                        |
| Within HDB estates and in areas with GPR more than 1.4                                                             | Up to 1.4                                        |
| Within or at the fringe of industrial estates                                                                      | Up to 1.4                                        |
| Within Central Area and within other commercial centres, including party-wall developments such as in Geylang area | Subject to evaluation and localised urban design | guidelines. |

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage reserve(1) (DR) and/or road reserve(2) (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

GPR for sites where vesting is required

![GPR for sites where vesting is required](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

For redevelopment of existing approved C&CI developments or to carry out major extensions to them, the proposed increase in GPR or Gross Floor Area (GFA) is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the development, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

- (2) **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)

LUSH is a comprehensive urban and skyrise greening programme comprising both Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) requirements and incentives to provide greenery and communal spaces.

The LRA requirements are calibrated by location, GPR and development type. A development may count Sky Terraces, Communal Planter Boxes and Covered Communal Ground Gardens (see Greenery sub-tabs) amongst other features, towards meeting the LRA requirement.

Applicants may refer to the following self-help checklists for the applicable greenery requirements and information to be submitted for assessment: for private developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Private-Developments.pdf) and public sector developments [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Documents/LUSH-Checklist-For-Public-Sector-Developments.pdf).

Landscape Replacement Areas

![Image 2: Landscape Replacement Areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F09_Landscape_Replacement_Small.jpg?h=580&w=1000)

#### Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) Guidelines in Strategic Areas

Developments in identified Strategic Areas shall provide LRA that is minimally equivalent to the development’s gross site area, as shown in the table and diagram below. At least 40% of the LRA requirement shall be reserved for softscape (permanent planting) areas. The remaining LRA requirement may be provided as hardscape.

The Green Plot Ratio (GnPR) provides an objective measure of the density of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Image 3: Green Plot Ratio formula](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/GnPR_Calculation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25)

The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be obtained online from NParks’ [Flora Fauna Web](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb) by searching the common or scientific names of plants.

The LRA requirement is not applicable to conserved buildings in historic conservation areas. URA may exercise flexibility on LRA requirements when evaluating individual developments affected by specific constraints.

The table below shows the guidelines for computation of LRAs in Strategic Areas. LRA in Strategic Areas is the sum of:

- Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds;
- Horizontal surface area of the hardscape eg communal facilities, urban farm; and

| General Guidelines                        | To qualify as LRA, all horizontal areas shall be: unenclosed and open-to-sky, or if covered, open sided, naturally ventilated, and qualify for GFA exemption under a LUSH incentive scheme (eg Communal Planter Boxes, Covered Communal Ground Gardens and/or, Sky Terraces). Rooftop urban farms counted as GFA may be counted as LRA subject to the guidelines under the Hardscape Area section below. All LRA shall be designed taking into account safety and maintenance considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Softscape Areas                           | These are permanent, sunken planting areas which shall be designed with sufficient soil depth to accommodate a variety of plant types.A minimum soil depth of 1000mm shall be provided for trees and palms, 500mm for shrubs and climbers, and 300mm for ground covers. Potted plants do not count as softscape.As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds at maximum 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs (ie no turfing allowed). This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hardscape Areas                           | These are communal facilities (eg event plazas, playgrounds and water features), surrounded by lush landscaping. Fire engine accessways may be considered as hardscape areas if they are communally accessible in times of non-emergency and are surrounded by lush landscaping. Covered Rooftop Urban Farms may count towards hardscape under the LRA requirement, up to 10% of site area and subject to the merits of the proposal. For crop protection, covers over rooftop urban farms may be allowed.Such covered urban farm area may be allowed on Temporary Permission and counted as Gross Floor Area, subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. URA may consider allowing additional GFA for farms over and above the maximum permissible GFA under the Master Plan.Prevailing building height controls shall continue to apply to any structures and equipment proposed at the roofs. Proposals within areas subject to Urban Design guidelines or Conservation requirements shall be evaluated according to prevailing controls. |
| Vertical Greenery & Extensive Green Roofs | May count towards either softscape or hardscape under the LRA requirement, up to 10% of site area. The following guidelines shall apply: Vertical greenery shall be publicly visible, e.g. placed at external building facade fronting key pedestrian thoroughfares, major public spaces, and main entrance areas, etc. Vertical greenery for sites in Urban Design areas eg Central Area and Key Growth areas (see the Urban Design Guidelines on URA SPACE) may be subject to additional urban design requirements. Extensive green roofs shall be of a substantial size to contribute to green cover and support biodiversity. Apart from maintenance purposes, extensive green roofs shall not be accessible for other users. Horizontal trellis-based greenery shall not qualify as extensive green roofs.For vertical green proposing support systems, planter boxes of minimum 500mm depth are encouraged to be provided at every storey for dense plant growth.                                                                                            |
| Areas that do not qualify as LRA          | Service facilities, eg vehicular drop-offs, drive ways, etc and its ancillary greenery.Circulation areas, eg stairs, ramps, walkways, etc and its ancillary greenery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ownership                                 | In strata subdivided developments, the LRAs shall be part of common property. Building owners shall retain the required LRAs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Clearance Process and Requirements        | URA’s clearance of the completed Landscape Replacement Areas provided by developments within Strategic Areas is required before the Commissioner of Building Control issues the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), or Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC) (when TOP is not required). In your submission, please include accurately labelled photographs (in pdf file format) showing the completed Landscape Replacement Areas. URA will evaluate the photographs submitted and, if necessary, arrange for a site inspection before issuing the Clearance for the completed works. Applicants are also required to declare upfront to the Commissioner of Building Control at the point of application for TOP or CSC (when TOP is not required), that URA’s Clearance is required for Landscape Replacement Areas before issuance of TOP, or CSC (when TOP is not required).                                                                                                                                                                               |

#### Plan Presentation Requirements for Landscape Replacement Areas

A Landscape Plan for all Landscape Replacement Areas shall be submitted together with the Development Application, as illustrated below.

Landscape Plan template:

_![Image 4: Landscape Plan template](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F10_Example_of_Landscape_Plan.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)_

The plans shall include:

- Relevant plans, cross sections and perspectives with layouts of the softscape and hardscape areas. The softscape and hardscape areas shall be visually differentiated on plans with the following details:
  - Computations of the overall LRA, softscape areas and Green Plot Ratio;
  - Proposed schedule and annotation of plant species and paving materials;
  - Where relevant, annotations of ancillary uses e.g. Swimming Pool, BBQ Area, etc.;
  - Where relevant, annotations of the 45-degree line;
  - Short statement on the proposed maintenance and irrigation methods for the planting.

Label and package the landscape plans and sections separately from the rest of the floor plans, and separate the softscape and hardscape areas into different layers.

URA’s approval is required if there are changes to the softscape areas (eg planting and structure of the planting beds) and hardscape areas that result in an overall reduction in area for the required LRAs.

URA’s approval is not required for changes to the planting species as long as the softscape and Green Plot Ratio requirements are complied with.

The following table for GnPR computation shall be filled in and submitted together with the landscape plans.

### LUSH Incentives

The following incentive schemes can be used throughout the development to provide greenery and communal spaces.

#### Sky Terraces

Sky terraces are communal garden spaces provided at the intermediate storeys of a building.

To qualify for GFA exemption, sky terraces shall comply with the criteria in the following table.

##### Sky Terrace Area as % of Floor Plate

- Sky Terrace: Not applicable
- Predominant Sky Terrace: The sky terrace area within the 45-degree line occupies equal to or more than 60% of the floor plate.

##### Perimeter Openness

- Sky Terrace: At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: At least 60% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is open(1) and unenclosed.

Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to be considered open.

##### Depth of Sky Terrace

The proposed depth of the sky terrace shall be minimally 5.0m throughout.

#### Landscaping

Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. The planting shall be well externalised.

Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the usage of the sky terrace.

As an alternative to providing sunken planting beds, building owners can provide well-landscaped, raised planting beds up to 300mm high, planted with trees or shrubs. This facilitates compliance with FSSD’s fire safety requirements on habitable space.

The sky terraces shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

##### Accessibility and Ownership

The sky terrace shall be accessible to all occupants of the building and there shall be at least one set of communal access via a lift or staircase serving the sky terrace. Secondary access to the sky terrace from strata units can be supported.

The layout of sky terrace floors shall be subject to evaluation to ensure that the sky terrace space is meant for communal use and is not treated as a privatised space. For sky terraces in residential developments that occupy less than 60% of the floor plates, the sky terraces shall serve a minimum of 2 strata units to ensure that they remain as communal space. They shall remain as common property in strata subdivided developments.

##### Drop Panels

Where proposed, drop panels at the perimeter shall be visually transparent and may be in the form of louvres, fins, transparent glass, or other sun shading/weather protective devices. The panel shall not exceed one third of the height of the external opening. The area of GFA exemption(2) as defined by a 45-degree line shall be taken from the underside of any permanent or opaque structure, and not from the underside of a drop panel.

##### Additional Height

- Sky Terrace: Not eligible.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: Refer to Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey sub-section in the Residential and Non-Residential Handbooks.

##### GFA Exemption

- Sky Terrace: For sky terraces occupying less than 60% of the floor plate, the maximum area for GFA exemption of the sky terrace is defined by the area covered by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection.
- Predominant Sky Terrace: URA may grant additional GFA exemption for residual areas beyond the 45-degree line (capped at 20% of the floor plate area), if such areas form an integral part of the sky terrace or are part of the barrier-free/fire escape corridors.

Corridors may be exempted from GFA computation for all sky terraces regardless of size subject to the following criteria:

- The corridor lies within the 45-degree exemption area;
- The corridor serves the sky terrace; and
- At least 40% of the perimeter of the sky terrace is to remain open(1) and unenclosed.
- The corridor does not serve as the primary access to units located on the same floor as the sky terrace.

##### Submission Requirements

A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for the sky terrace showing the proposed landscaping scheme, planting palette, soil depth and communal facilities shall be submitted as part of the Development Application.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Parapet walls shall not exceed 1.3m in height to allow for more openness.
- (2): The 45-degree GFA exemption area may be taken from all external parapet walls (including recessed external parapet walls) surrounding the sky terrace.

Typical Landscape Plan

#### Communal Planter Boxes

Communal planter boxes shall comply with the following criteria:

- Maximum width of 1m;
- Minimum depth of 500mm (for planting purpose);
- To be sufficiently externalized.

Communal planter boxes which are more than 1.0m wide may be allowed if the wider planter boxes are part of an overall scheme with design merit.

Details of the communal planter boxes, including planting palette, spot sections showing soil depth, and dimensions shall be provided as part of the storey plans.

Communal planter boxes shall be designed with safety and maintainability provisions in mind.

#### Covered Communal Ground Gardens

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1st storey. The garden should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

1.  Predominant C2G2s shall occupy at least 50% of the first storey building footprint. Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped, while the remaining 40% can be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces, and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds, and covered pools. Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping.
2.  Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be exempted from GFA computation up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The GFA-exempted communal areas within the 45-degree line shall contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

All areas of C2G2 spaces shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

For GFA exemption for C2G2, refer to the [GFA handbook](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area). URA will assess the C2G2’s design, spatial quality and overall integration with the wider landscaping scheme in considering the proposal’s eligibility for GFA exemption.

A landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the Development Application for the predominant covered ground garden proposal, showing the proposed landscaping scheme.

#### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to the pavilions shall be from the common areas only.

In addition to being sited within lushly landscaped areas, they shall satisfy the criteria below to qualify for GFA exemption:

date: 5 July 2019
---

Purpose-built Homes for the Aged or Homes for the Disabled are meant to provide residential accommodation with board and care for the elderly and the disabled respectively.

Homes for the Aged are licensed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

Free-standing or independent Homes for the Aged/Disabled are typically zoned "Civic and Community Institution" or "Residential/Institution" in the Master Plan. They may be allowed at the void decks of public housing blocks as facilities ancillary to the residential use.

Conversion of properties to Homes for the Aged or Disabled and the actual allowable building form (i.e., stand-alone or party-wall) will be assessed taking into account the site location, site context and detailed development guidelines in the prevailing street block plans, if any.

### Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The allowable gross plot ratio and number of storeys for Homes for the Aged or Disabled developments shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

Homes for the Aged or Disabled of 3-storeys and above shall be provided with lifts.

For the redevelopment of an existing approved Home for the Aged or Disabled to carry out major extensions to it, the proposed increase in GPR or GFA is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of the home, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before commencement of works.

### Communal Open Space

Homes for the Aged or Disabled shall provide a minimum 35% communal open space (COS) (based on nett site area) for use as recreational spaces for enjoyment by the occupants. Spaces which qualify as COS are shown below:

Examples of spaces that qualify as COS

- Recreational facilities that are uncovered and raised no more than 1m above ground level such as:
  - Exercise equipment and structures in fitness areas.
  - Game courts for tennis, basketball etc.
  - Swimming pool; wading pool.
- Structures that form part of landscaping features such as

- **Community**: Association/Clan Buildings, Community Clubs/Centres, Welfare Homes, Home for the Aged, Funeral Parlours, Childcare Centres
- **Cultural**: Performing Arts Centre, Library, Museum, Arts/Science Centre, Art Gallery

A C&CI building may be a stand-alone or party-wall building. The actual allowable building form will be assessed taking into account the site location, site context, and detailed development guidelines in the prevailing street block plans, if any.

Strata subdivision is not allowed for C&CI developments.

All C&CI developments shall adhere to the planning parameters and guidelines except for Community Centres/Clubs and Homes for the Aged – see their guidelines under the tab [Home for the Aged](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/Home) and [Community Centres/Clubs](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/CC) respectively.



## Parking
---
title: Parking
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/Parking
date: 31 August 2023
---

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

### Car and Motor-Cycle Parking

Under LTA’s Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments are subject to car and motor-cycle(1) parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

#### Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS)

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html).

Range-based Parking Provision Standards:

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Range_Based_Car_Parking_Standard.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

New C&CI developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation by LTA if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking lots, i.e., parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential developments.

### Bicycle Parking

To promote a car-lite society, C&CI developments may be required to provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to LTA’s Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/vehicle_parking/requirements_for_vehicle_parking_proposals.html) for the list of requirements. Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property. Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA’s new standards are exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of the development.

### Introduction

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes only(1). Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls(2) and the following guidelines.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies’ requirements for safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.
- (2): Height controls applicable, include:
  - Absolute technical height constraints(@) (e.g. Aviation paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
  - Conservation guidelines (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
  - Urban design height controls (available at [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))
- (@): The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum [SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other height controls.

### Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

- Maximum 500sqm(1) or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.
- For developments which have reached the allowable storey height control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an additional storey.
- For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height or are not located within areas subject to storey height control, maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be allowed.
- Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building users and visible from the surroundings.
- Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
- A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

#### Definitions and Notes

- (1): The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof eaves line.

### Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if they meet the following criteria:

- a. Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
- b. The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the solar panel system does not require planning permission except in locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

- a. **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation Areas(2) shall require planning permission due to their impact on the roofscape.**

- b. **Elevated solar panels(3) located in developments on the following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

  - Residential (landed housing, flats and condominium housing developments)
  - Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey
  - Mixed Commercial & Residential
  - Commercial
  - Hotel
  - White
  - Residential / Institution
  - Commercial / Institution
  - Educational Institution
  - Place of Worship
  - Civic & Community Institution

- c. **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use**
  - Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they comply with the guidelines below:

Guidelines for Elevated Solar Panels

| **Parameter** | **Guidelines**                                                      |

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/index.html?service=CTRLPLAN).

### Special Control Areas

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

Special Control Area 1

![LSpecial Control Area 1 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-1.jpg?h=416&w=750)

Special Control Area 2

[Link to Special Control Area 2 Image](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/Special-Control-Area-2.jpg?h=383&w=750)

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The following screening measures may be considered:

#### Visual Screening

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be re-orientated such that the windows(1)/openings/balconies do not have direct view towards the protected area.

##### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Window: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in the submission plans for URA’s evaluation and approval.

#### Roof Screening

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm system monitored by the building management.

title: Urban Design Requirements
link: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/C-CI/UD
date: 22 October 2019
---

Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) are to preserve and enhance the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

Developments in the Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District, and Woodlands Central), may be guided by specific [urban design requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design), where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses. These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

Refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design/URA-SPACE/UD-URA-SPACE) for the Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

### Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

- a. Urban Design Areas shown in the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design Plan;
- b. Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
- c. Sites that undergo redevelopment or major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning conditions issued for these works;
- d. Other areas as directed and specified by the Competent Authority.

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

- a. 1st storey of developments fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
- b. Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments;
- c. Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2nd storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact the surrounding developments.

#### Example of uses that may be considered as Activity Generating Uses (AGUs) are:

- Shop
- Showroom/galleries
- Restaurant
- Pet shop/pet grooming
- Banks, adjoining or independent ATM clusters
- Commercial school
- Childcare centre/kindergarten
- Gym/fitness centre
- Visitor Centre/ museum
- Hotel/ Backpackers’ hostel
- Self-service laundry

#### The following uses are not AGUs:

- Office
- Bar
- Nightclub
- Massage establishment
- LAN gaming centre

date: 2 Aug 2023
---

Workers' dormitory are premises used to house migrant workers who are engaged to carry out industrial or production or construction activities. Independent workers' dormitories are free-standing developments which are not located within industrial sites. These may be allowed on Permanent or Temporary Permission subject to evaluation depending on the merits of the case.

\*Note: The following guidelines are for independent workers' dormitories. Temporary workers' dormitories occupying new extensions or blocks within the industrial developments or converted from existing spaces within the industrial developments may be allowed on land zoned B1 or B2. Click [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B1/Allowable-Uses/WD) for guidelines for temporary workers' dormitories.

### Location

All new proposed independent workers' dormitories or increase in capacity of existing independent workers' dormitories are assessed on the merits of the case.

They shall not fall within NEA and SCDF's health and safety buffer zones.

Prior clearances from NEA, PUB, SCDF, and LTA shall be obtained before a proposal is submitted to URA for evaluation.

Workers' dormitories are not allowed within the Central Area and on land zoned Business Park/Business Park-White.

### Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The maximum GPR for independent workers' dormitories is subject to contextual evaluation.

The number of storeys for dormitories shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary, depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding area.

### Building Setback

All independent workers' dormitories shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve(1) line or boundary line to the external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.

All independent workers' dormitories fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1 below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

#### Definitions and Notes

(1) **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Common boundary with other developments | Minimum 3m (including 2m planting strip requirement) |

### Use Quantum

100% of the GFA may be used for dormitory use and ancillary amenities.

### Floor-to-Floor Height

A maximum 3.6m floor-to-floor height control shall apply to new independent workers' dormitories.

### Maximum Number of Workers

The maximum number of workers/residents allowed in a dormitory is subject to planning assessment by URA and requirements of technical agencies such as LTA, PUB, SCDF, NEA, MOM, and SPF. It is also subjected to the living space standard of minimum 4.2sqm of living space per resident\*, whichever is lower.

\*Living space per resident was set out in MOM-MND-MOH's press release dated 17 Sept 2021. See details in Amenity Provision Guidelines.

### Subdivision

No land or strata subdivision of the dormitories is allowed.

### Amenity Provision Guidelines

To enhance liveability for workers/residents in a dormitory and strengthen resilience against future pandemics, adequate facilities and amenities shall be provided as part of the dormitory development based on the requirements stated in the table below.

**Applications for new workers' dormitory use are to comply with all the requirements (e.g. living space per resident, occupancy per bedroom unit, etc) as stated in the [press release](https://go.gov.sg/improved-dormitory-standards) issued by MOM, MND and MOH dated 17 Sept 2021.**

#### Living Space Standards

As per MOM-MND-MOH's press release dated 17 Sept 2021, a minimum 4.2sqm of living space per resident shall be provided.

The 4.2sqm of living space per resident includes the sleeping and living areas in the rooms. However, it excludes designated functional areas, such as the en-suite toilets, kitchens, and yard spaces.

date: 5 July 2019
---

To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces, developments at major waterbodies(1) shall observe the design and development application submission guidelines below.

![Waterbodies Image 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C16_Waterbodies_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

![Waterbodies Image 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/C17_Waterbodies_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)

### Design Guidelines

1. Retaining Walls

   - Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the following criteria:
     - a. Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;
     - b. Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;
     - c. Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

2. Boundary Walls/Fences

   - For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence).
   - For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:
     - a. Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall be aesthetically treated.
     - b. Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

3. Slope

   - There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall not exceed 1:2.

4. Conservation of Vegetation

   - Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved, wherever possible.

### Development Application Submission Guidelines

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA, the following shall be provided, where applicable:

- Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage Reserve(2)/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;
- Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing and proposed ground levels;
- Design details of integration with waterbody including slope, retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type, Screening);
- Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;
- [Checklist](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/Forms/Supplementary-forms/waterbodycl.doc) for Waterbodies-related proposals.

### Application of Guidelines

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development application submission guidelines listed above.

#### Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea

For land use planning and development control purposes, the foreshore(3) and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward side of the foreshore line(4) shall be kept free of structures. Some structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in connection with an approved development (e.g., marine industries, refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

### Definitions and Notes

- (1) Major waterbodies: rivers, canals of at least 17.5m width, reservoirs, and seas.
- (2) Drainage Reserve (DR): An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain
- (3) The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.
- (4) The high water mark of the Spring Tide; the top of the existing seawall or revertment or river wall (where appropriate) for controlling landward development.
