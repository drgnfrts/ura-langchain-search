*Setback Requirements for Mixed Commercial and Residential Developments*

All buildings in mixed commercial and residential developments shall be
sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback
distance is measured from the road reserve line or boundary line to the
external wall of the buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State
for road and/or drainage purpose.

All buildings in mixed commercial and residential developments fronting
a public road shall provide a road buffer, the width of which depends on
the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer shall be set aside in the road
buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The road buffer and common boundary setback requirements for mixed
commercial and residential developments are determined by the building
form, and are detailed in the table below.

-   The site is constrained or if there is an intention to retain the
    existing streetscape which is abutting the road reserve line.
