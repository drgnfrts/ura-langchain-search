| **Urban Design Guidelines**  | ### Size and Configuration<ul><li>The public space area should be large enough to improve the amenity of the local area and serve as a meaningful space for users. As a guide, the public space area should be at least:</li><ul><li>1sqm of public space area for every 50sqm of total development GFA; or</li><li>25% of the development's building footprint. (whichever is lower)</li></ul><li>Covered public spaces should have high volume of at least two storeys or an appropriate height in proportion to its size.</li><li>At least 75% of the total public space area should consist of a contiguous space which is regular in shape, subject to detailed evaluation.</li></ul>### Access and Location<ul><li>The public space should be located at the first storey with a frontage onto a major street or pedestrian thoroughfare.</li><li>The public space frontage should be open and unobstructed to allow for easy pedestrian access and be highly visible from the adjoining street or pedestrian thoroughfare.</li></ul><ul><li>The access and circulation within the public space should be barrier-free and comply with BCA’s universal design guidelines.</li></ul>### Public Seating and Amenities<ul><li>Public seating should be provided. The minimum requirement is one seat per 20sqm of public space area (1m of bench/ledge = 2 seats).</li><li>A variety of seating to cater to different users, age groups and physical abilities is encouraged, e.g. seats with back and arm rests are highly encouraged to cater to the elderly; movable seats to allow for interaction, etc.</li><li>The public space may include other amenities to encourage public use of the space such as:</li><ul><li>Design Features: Public Art, Water Features;</li><li>Furniture + Equipment: Tables, Play/Exercise Equipment, Built-in Lighting and Audio Equipment for events; and</li><li>Services: Drinking Fountains, Wi-Fi Connection, Phone Charging Points.</li></ul></ul>### Shade<ul><li>The public space should be well shaded to encourage public use throughout the day.</li><li>Shade can be provided by integration within the building form, by adjacent buildings, trees, canopies/pergolas, adjustable umbrellas/awnings, and/or landscape elements.</li><li>The material used to provide shade must not result in additional heat retention in the public space.</li><li>Sun shadow study should be undertaken to demonstrate that sufficient shade is provided between 9:00am and 4:00pm. Shadow diagrams are to be studied for shadow cast on 21 Jun: at 9:00am, 12:00pm and 4:00pm. For each shadow diagram:</li><ul><li>At least 50% of the total public space area is to be shaded; and</li><li>At least 50% of public space seating is to be shaded.</li></ul></ul>### Signage<ul><li>An information plaque shall be installed at a visible and fixed location near the main entrance of the public space.</li><li>The plaque should include the following information:</li><ul><li>Public Open Space logo measuring at least 30 cm by 30 cm;</li><li>“Open to public 24 hours” statement;</li><li>Public space owner and their contact information.</li><li>No smoking sign</li></ul><li>Refer to [Annex 1-1](https://www.example.com) for the template file in PDF (editable in Adobe Illustrator) and high resolution logo image.</li><li>All text on the signage should be highly contrasting with the background colour of the sign, at least 20mm in height, and in a highly legible font.</li><li>The signage must be constructed of highly durable material such as metal or stone that is fully opaque and non-reflective.</li><li>The signage should be integrated with other signage in the same vicinity (if any), to reduce visual clutter.</li></ul> |
| **Operational Guidelines**   | <ul><li>The public space:</li><ul><li>Must be open to the public at all times;</li><li>Cannot be enclosed and cannot be converted to any other permanent uses in the future; and</li><li>Must remain as common property, in the event of strata subdivision.</li></ul><ul><li>ORA within POPS, if any, must remain as common property (i.e. as part of the public space), in the event of strata subdivision.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
