URA's reply, 24 Jan 2022

We thank writer Long Zi An for his feedback (Plan for landmark buildings for Singapore River, Jan 18, 2022).

URA formulates urban design plans and guidelines to ensure that buildings and spaces collectively contribute positively to the users and visitors' experience of different places in Singapore.

The urban design guidelines for Singapore River focus on capitalising on its river frontage and heritage to create an attractive waterfront lifestyle destination, with pedestrian-friendly promenades and public spaces.

For selected developments fronting the riverfront promenade and key pedestrian malls, developments are required to provide public spaces to promote city life. These public spaces are guided to be more open and airy; well landscaped and shaded; and connected to key pedestrian routes at street level. They must also be publicly accessible at all times.

As an example, with the redevelopment of the former Liang Court, the existing road fronting Singapore River will be closed to vehicular traffic and turned into a pedestrianised waterfront promenade. In addition, instead of a large podium, the upcoming mixed-use project CanningHill Piers has been guided to create a publicly accessible and porous ground floor that includes an open-to-sky public space.

A new hotel development has also been planned above the Fort Canning MRT station, under the Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme. The developer will be required to provide a new public open space at street level that can accommodate a range of activities and events, and enhance the overall pedestrian experience along Singapore River.

We will continue to work closely with developers to facilitate more quality developments that contribute to an attractive environment in this area for all to enjoy.
