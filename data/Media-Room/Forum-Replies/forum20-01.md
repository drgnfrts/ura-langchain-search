URA's reply, 3 Jan 2020

We thank Mr Damien Ng Swee Beng for his feedback (Build park in Irwell Bank Road, Dec 27, 2019).

Injecting more housing in the River Valley area will provide opportunities for more people to live in the city and near public transport nodes. At the same time, provision of greenery and open spaces has always been a consideration even as we plan for developments.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority will be guiding the developer of the future residential site in Irwell Bank Road to retain some of the existing mature trees and to provide landscaping that will maintain the overall green ambience of the area.

There will also be a linear park in the area, which will link residents from River Valley to Kim Seng Park and the Alexandra Canal Linear Park.

We also work with the National Parks Board to plan for new parks and green spaces in the city, such as the recently completed Jubilee Park and Armenian Street Park on the foothills of Fort Canning Park.

**Build park in Irwell Bank Road**

I learnt with much dismay that the plot of land at the corner of Irwell Bank Road and River Valley Road is being put up for sale for future residential development (URA launches tender for Irwell Bank Road site, Nov 1).  
  
I am not sure if we need any more housing in this heavily congested area. This vacant plot may be better used as a much-needed "green lung" for the residents living around the area.  
  
Perhaps consider setting up a new park with a jogging track and trees, as well as carving a sheltered area for parked bicycles for residents who might then catch the train at the upcoming Great World MRT station, which would be only a five-minute walk from this park.  
  
This green development would be in line with the future "car-lite" society.
