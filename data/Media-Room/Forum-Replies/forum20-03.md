We refer to the article which stated that "the concept plans for JLD are up for strategic review" ("URA seeks marketing consultancy for strategic review of Jurong Lake District to draw businesses", The Business Times, published on May 2).

We would like to clarify that the concept plans for Jurong Lake District (JLD) are not up for review.

URA has called a tender for the development of a marketing strategy for JLD.

Apart from developing a marketing narrative and positioning for JLD to potential investors, the consultant is also required to come up with marketing collaterals for the relevant target markets.

Since the blueprint for JLD was unveiled in 2008, the district has attracted a critical mass with its mixed-use developments into the Jurong Gateway area.

In 2017, a master plan to shape JLD into a vibrant and sustainable business district with recreational uses and greenery was announced.

The first phase of the Jurong Lake Gardens was opened last year.

In addition, new developments such as the second phase of the Gardens, the new Science Centre, an attraction by the Singapore Tourism Board, and MRT stations of the Jurong Region Line and Cross-Island Line will also be coming on stream.

We look forward to having a marketing consultant onboard to attract businesses to JLD.
