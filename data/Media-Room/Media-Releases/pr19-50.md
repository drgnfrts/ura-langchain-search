The Chief Planner has gazetted Master Plan 2019 today. The Master Plan is the statutory land use plan that guides the physical development of Singapore over the next 10 to 15 years.

As part of Master Plan 2019, the former Railway Station Staff Quarters and the former Bukit Timah Fire Station have also been gazetted for conservation.

The gazette concludes the review of Draft Master Plan 2019, which was exhibited at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) from late March till June 2019.

Over 25,000 stakeholders and interested members of public visited URA during the exhibition period to find out more about the proposals, with some 6,000 visitors also signing up for guided tours by URA volunteers and staff. To reach out to more residents, regional plans were also exhibited at Waterway Point, Westgate, Junction 8, Our Tampines Hub and Causeway Point between late July and early August.

Online, there were more than 110,000 visitors to the Draft Master Plan 2019 webpages, while URA's social media posts on the proposals reached close to 583,000 netizens.

**Engaging as we plan**

Over the past few years, URA has engaged stakeholders, including residents, interest groups, professional institutes, grassroots leaders and Advisors, on our plans.

The constructive feedback gathered from these stakeholders through focus groups, dialogues, workshops, briefings and exhibitions have helped to shape our draft plans. In particular, stakeholder feedback from these sessions helped to refine the original plans for Kallang River, Jurong Lake District, Farrer Park, Holland Plain and Lorong Chuan, and shape our plans to support the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and the Central Business District. The refined plans were subsequently exhibited as part of Draft Master Plan 2019. The early engagement had also allowed planners to update stakeholders on the actions taken prior to the Draft Master Plan 2019 exhibition.

Suggestions and feedback for the Draft Master Plan 2019 proposals have been incorporated where appropriate, and will be considered as we develop detailed plans for future areas.

URA will continue to work with fellow government agencies to engage our stakeholders so that together, we make Singapore a great place to live, work and play.
