The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has released two residential sites at Champions Way and Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, and a short-term lease commercial site at Punggol Walk for sale today under the 1st half 2023 (1H2023) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.   
  
**Residential sites at Champions Way and Lorong 1 Toa Payoh**  
   
The residential site at Champions Way is launched for sale under the Confirmed List and can potentially yield about 350 residential units. It forms part of the 4,090 residential units1 to be made available via the Confirmed List of the 1H2023 GLS programme and represents a 17% increase from the 3,505 units made available in 2H2022. The residential site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh is available for application under the Reserve List and can potentially yield an additional 775 residential units. Together, the two residential sites can yield about 1,125 residential units.   
  
**Short-term lease commercial site at Punggol Walk**  
  
As part of the Government's efforts to support decentralisation and cater to demand for workspaces near homes, the Government has released a commercial site at Punggol Walk on the Reserve List, with a 30-year lease tenure and a potential yield of about 8,400 sqm of office space. The release of sites on shorter lease allows our land uses to be refreshed in shorter cycles to support businesses in adapting their operations more nimbly to changing economic trends and market demand.  
   
Details on the three land parcels can be found in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/May/URA-pr23-15a_v2.pdf) .
