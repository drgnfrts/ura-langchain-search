 presents a curated mix of more than 20 programmes alongside 331 light art installations from 28 January to 24 February 2019. An anchor event to kick-start the Singapore Bicentennial commemoration in 2019, the Festival will connect people across generations through shared experiences, delectable food, delightful music and immersive play, while promoting awareness about sustainability and the evolution of our city through time.

Spanning Marina Bay, the Civic District, Singapore River and Raffles Terrace at Fort Canning Park,  will feature five distinct programming hubs for festival-goers looking for a fun, engaging and unique experience as they traverse our iconic waterfront – bridging old and new Singapore along the Festival route.

Hosting the light art installations for the first time, the historic Raffles Terrace at Fort Canning Park will welcome visitors with a musical experience, as the National Parks Board presents **_Festival at the Fort @ i Light Singapore_**. Programme highlights include acoustic music acts and special piano showcases by local talents, roving performances, movie screenings and guided tours of the historic Fort Canning Hill led by fellow heritage lovers.

In line with the sustainability focus of the light art festival, The Lawn @ Marina Bay will be transformed into **_Eco Lawn @ i Light Singapore_**, where environmental sustainability, fitness, and social good come together. Visitors can join local environmental social enterprise Terra SG to try their hands at a diverse range of upcycling workshops, or go on an ecologically-responsible shopping spree at the  light art installation.

Adding to the festivities, families and friends can gather at **_Camp Kilo @ i Light Singapore_** at Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza to enjoy eclectic groovy beats by resident DJs, engage in warm conversations and indulge in hearty outdoor grilled food served on biodegradable food ware.

For those looking for fun and thrill, **_Prudential Marina Bay Carnival @ i Light Singapore_** located at Bayfront Event Space will fit the bill with 50 thrilling rides and games from around the world, coupled with entertaining programmes and performances that are set to turn the precinct into a LED-lit, vibrant playground.

Students from various performance groups of the Republic Polytechnic will be playing their part in enlivening our public spaces as part of the Festival programme. Different spots at Marina Bay will turn into a performance stage on 2 February 2019 as these students captivate festival-goers with their delightful showcase of percussion music, hip hop dances and martial arts.
