The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has launched a residential with commercial at first storey site at Marina Gardens Lane for sale by public tender today under the Confirmed List of the second half 2022 (2H2022) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.  
  
Located in the Marina South precinct, this site can potentially yield about 790 residential units. Details of the land parcel can be found in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2022/Dec/pr22-46a.pdf) .  
  
**A new community-centric residential precinct at Marina South**  
  
Situated next to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, and overlooking Marina Reservoir and the Straits of Singapore, the 45-ha Marina South precinct has been planned as a mixed-use residential neighbourhood comprising a mix of residential, hotel, retail and some office uses.   
  
Envisioned as a sustainable, car-lite and community-centric residential precinct, Marina South will be characterised by pedestrian-friendly streets, a comprehensive cycling network, a pedestrian mall and an underground pedestrian network connecting the two Thomson East Coast Line stations at Gardens by the Bay and Marina South. A series of planned elevated pedestrian connections will seamlessly connect the precinct to Gardens by the Bay and to the coast. The subject site is located next to the upcoming Marina South MRT station.   
  
When fully developed, Marina South can potentially have more than 10,000 dwelling units, enjoying good access to amenities such as parks, public spaces, recreational options, shops and F&B outlets, as well as community facilities such as childcare centres. Future residents of Marina South will enjoy the benefits of a more sustainable precinct as developments in the area are required to attain BCA's Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy certification. To build a vibrant residential neighbourhood, the Government is studying various possible housing options to be introduced to realise the long-term planning vision for the precinct. The launch of the first land parcel at Marina Gardens Lane will kickstart the development of this new Marina South neighbourhood.   
  
More information on the planning and urban design aspirations for Marina South can be found [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design/Marina-South).  
  
**Other details**  
  
The tender for the Marina Gardens Lane site will close at 12 noon on 27 June 2023.   
  
The tender closing for this site will be batched with an Executive Condominium site at Tengah Plantation Loop and a Commercial & Residential site at Tampines Avenue 11, both of which will be launched in the later part of December 2022 under the Confirmed List of the 2H2022 GLS Programme.
