As we approach the end of 2019, Marina Bay and the Civic District are getting ready to welcome 2020 with a bustling countdown celebration lined up with exciting activities for all from day to night. From foodies to music enthusiasts, from animal lovers to thrill-seekers, as well as those in search of novelty experiences and free activities for the whole family, there is something for everyone! Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the 15th edition of Singapore's biggest countdown event **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2020_** will offer a festive atmosphere for everyone to usher in the New Year together.

**Welcoming 2020 with hopes and dreams**

Revellers will be treated to a visual spectacle as the three iconic facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion are adorned with colourful and dazzling light projections reflecting the hopes and dreams of our community. These projections are adapted from some 50 artworks by over 40 individuals from four social service organisations, and showcase the artists' aspirations for the future. This is part of the ** in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC).

Starting from 26 December, the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore will light up with artworks created by the beneficiaries from Beyond Social Services and SHINE Children and Youth Services, providing an imaginative glimpse into their future through the creative minds of our next generation. Journey through various whimsical worlds, exploring a starry universe, underwater seascape and even a candy factory! Catch the nightly light projections between 8pm and 10.30pm from 26 to 30 December and between 8pm and 11.30pm on New Year's Eve.

Joining in the visual extravaganza from 29 December, the facades of the Merlion and ArtScience Museum will come alive with a kaleidoscope of dancing colours. The light projection on the façade of the Merlion will showcase artworks co-created by the elderly patients and volunteers of the Yishun Community Hospital. These artworks are part of the patients' expression therapy with the volunteers, and reflect the volunteers' hope for the elderly to age actively. The light projection tells the meaningful story of the community's shared experiences and values passed down from past generations. The public can catch the nightly light projections on the Merlion between 8pm and 10.30pm from 29 to 30 December, and between 8pm and 11.30pm on 31 December.

Over at the ArtScience Museum, beneficiaries of the Dyslexia Association of Singapore will share how people with dyslexia relate to the world, and their hope to create an even more inclusive society. The public can catch the nightly light projections between 8.15pm and 10.30pm from 29 to 31 December.
