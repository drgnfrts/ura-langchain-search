The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) jointly announced today that the lease for the land currently occupied by Raffles Town Club Pte. Ltd. (RTC) at 1 Plymouth Avenue will not be renewed when it expires on 17 October 2026. The land is slated for future residential development.  
  
**Site to be put for future residential use**  
  
The redevelopment of the site, which is in close proximity to the Stevens MRT interchange, for residential use will support future housing demand and enhance the residential character of the precinct, and enable future residents to benefit from the transport infrastructure and connectivity to the city and around the island. This is also in line with the focus of redeveloping brownfield sites as much as possible to meet future demand for land, including housing.    
  
To facilitate the redevelopment plans, the lease for the land currently occupied by RTC will not be renewed upon its lease expiry. RTC can continue its operations at its current site until the lease expires on 17 October 2026, upon which RTC will be required to return the land to the State. SLA will work closely with RTC on the return of the land.

Should RTC wish to continue operations after its current lease expires, agencies will engage RTC on the availability of suitable State properties through open tender, or RTC can explore other options from the open market.
