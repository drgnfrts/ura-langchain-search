 Light displays and projection shows at Marina Bay in December; heartland fireworks on New Year's Eve to welcome 2022

  Published: 29 November 2021

Come this December, the Marina Bay skyline will be illuminated by vibrant light beams and projection shows to uplift our spirits and welcome the New Year. Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), in support of the **Singapore Together** movement1, Singapore's most iconic countdown event – the **_Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) 2022_** – will feature the return of two key highlights: **_Shine a Light_**, an inspirational light display, and **_Share the Moment_**, a visual storytelling showcase. For the second year running, fireworks will be set off from various heartland locations on 31 December 2021. There will be no fireworks at Marina Bay to prevent large crowds from gathering in the precinct, and to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19.

**Light display symbolising unity and strength**

The  display, which made its debut at last year's MBSC, will return with 60 light beams in a circular formation to be projected from The Promontory. These represent strength in diversity as we rally around one another to navigate the pandemic, and shine the spotlight on frontline workers, ground-up groups, as well as charities meeting needs within our communities during these difficult times.

This year, local philanthropic organisation The Majurity Trust has come on board as the community partner for Shine a Light. In conjunction with the light display, The Majurity Trust has embarked on a fundraising campaign to rally donors, corporates and private individuals, to ‘adopt' 60 light beams to symbolically brighten up the lives of those amongst us who are in need. The funds raised will go towards five grants that support various vulnerable communities in Singapore, such as youths struggling with mental health issues, people living with dementia and their caregivers, and at-risk families. Please see **[Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2021/Nov/pr21-49a_v2.pdf)**  campaign.

 will light up in a different colour to spotlight a different cause. From 29 to 31 December, the display will light up in magenta to represent the harmonious spirit of Singapore Together, and celebrate the partnerships forged between Singaporeans to create a caring, just and equal Singapore with opportunities for all.

In conjunction with the commencement of  on 1 December, TMT will also be holding an online launch to raise awareness of the campaign and allow the public to experience the light display virtually.

**Light projection shows featuring inspiring artworks to illuminate the façades of three iconic landmarks at Marina Bay**

MBSC 2022 will also bring back **_Share the Moment_**, a series of light projection shows in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and in support of its vision for a City of Good4. These light projections will feature original artworks by local students, who were inspired by the stories of this year's President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards5 nominees. Their illustrations portray heartwarming moments where people have come together to give their best for others during difficult times. Nightly light projection shows will transform the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion into a storytelling showcase.

 will be presented nightly from 26 to 31 December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended showtimes till 11.45pm on 31 December. The projection shows will take place every 15 minutes.

**Waterfront promenade light-up with creative installations**

To add to the festive cheer, part of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade adjacent to Marina Boulevard will also be lit up with special light installations and projections. Each embodying the spirit of creativity and hopefulness, the installations aim to offer visitors an uplifting experience as they walk through a kaleidoscope of colours on a treetop canopy, immerse themselves in a galaxy of stars, pose with an installation comprising lighted inflatable bird structures, or contemplate an abstract clockface projection display.

The waterfront promenade light installations will be on display nightly from 1 to 31 December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended display times on 31 December.

**Enjoy the community spirit at Marina Bay this festive season; celebrate the Countdown at home on New Year's Eve**

The key highlights of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown will take place throughout the month of December, so that visitors can enjoy them at their own time.

To mitigate the risk of large crowds gathering at Marina Bay on New Year's Eve, there will not be any fireworks display in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the Countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home. More information on the heartland fireworks will be provided in due course.

The public can also look forward to **_Let's Celebrate 2022_**, a New Year's Eve special by Mediacorp that will be broadcast on Channel 5 and streamed online via meWATCH and Mediacorp Entertainment YouTube Channel. The programme will showcase a dazzling line-up of the best and brightest in the Singapore music scene. Selected heartland fireworks and scenes from Marina Bay will also be featured in the show.

Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer of the URA said, "2021 has been another eventful year, where Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds have rallied behind one another in our efforts towards becoming a COVID-19-resilient nation. The Marina Bay Singapore Countdown is a signature occasion where Singaporeans and visitors collectively usher in the new year together in a meaningful way. This year's Countdown pays tribute to the partnerships that Singaporeans have forged through these challenging times, and signals a better 2022 for Singapore and Singaporeans all together. As public health and safety remain a priority, we welcome visitors to the Bay throughout the month of December and encourage all to enjoy the Countdown from the comfort of their home this New Year's Eve."

1The Singapore Together movement was launched in 2019 and encapsulates the vision for Singaporeans to partner with the government, and with one another, to own, shape and act on our shared future together.

2Except on 1 December, when the display will commence at 8.45pm instead.

3As a safety precaution, in the event of heavy rain and/or lightning, the light display will cease and resume only when weather conditions allow.

4City of Good is a vision of a Singapore, where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others. Giving our best for others means moving away from a ‘me-first' mindset and being others-centred.

5The President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards recognise individuals and groups that have achieved excellence in giving to the community and are conferred by the President of Singapore. It is organised by the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) with support from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).
