The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) closed the tender for the commercial and residential site at Sengkang Central today.  
  
The site was launched for sale via the Concept and Price (C&P) revenue tender system on 28 December 2017. Under this system, only the envelopes containing concept proposals were opened today and URA received a total of 7 tender submissions. Please see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2018/Jun/pr18-36a.pdf)  for the particulars of the tenderers.  
  
**Concept and Price Revenue Tender**   
  
Tenderers for the subject site at Sengkang Central were required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices in two separate envelopes.   
  
The concept proposals will be first evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee based on a set of criteria specified in the tender (see [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2018/Jun/pr18-36b.pdf) ). Only tenders that meet the evaluation criteria will be considered for award. At the second stage, the price envelopes of the proposals with acceptable concepts will be opened for consideration. The site will then be awarded to the tenderer with the highest bid price among those with acceptable concept proposals.  
  
This is not an announcement of tender award. A decision on the award of the tender will be made after the tenders have been evaluated. This will be published at a later date.
