The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released the flash estimate of the price index for private residential property for 2nd Quarter 2021 today.

Overall, the private residential property index increased by 1.5 points from 162.2 points in 1st Quarter 2021 to 163.7 points in 2nd Quarter 2021. This represents an increase of 0.9%, compared to the 3.3% increase in the previous quarter (see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2021/Jul/pr21-23a.pdf) ).  
   
Prices of non-landed private residential properties in the Core Central Region (CCR) increased by 0.6%, compared to the 0.5% increase in the previous quarter. Prices in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) increased by 0.3%, compared to the 6.1% increase in the previous quarter. Prices in Outside Central Region (OCR) increased by 1.8%, compared to the 1.1% increase in the previous quarter (see [Annex C](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2021/Jul/pr21-23c.pdf) ).  
   
The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment and data on units sold by developers up till mid-June. The statistics will be updated on 23 July 2021 when URA releases its full set of real estate statistics for 2nd Quarter 2021. Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution.
