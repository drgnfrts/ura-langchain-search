Starting from 1 April 2019, foreign vehicles with a number of outstanding fines for traffic, parking or vehicular emissions offences may be denied entry into Singapore. This move aims to strengthen enforcement of such offences.

**Background**

About 60,000 foreign vehicles enter Singapore daily. The majority of foreign motorists are law abiding. However, there are some who break our rules but do not settle their outstanding fines for offences committed.

Foreign motorists who enter Singapore must abide by Singapore's laws and settle any outstanding fines for offences. We take a serious view of those who do not do so. To remind foreign motorists to settle their outstanding fines, flyers have been distributed, and billboards displayed, at land checkpoints. Traffic Police and other Government agencies have also been conducting operations at the land checkpoints to detect such vehicles, to get them to settle their outstanding fines.

**Denial of Entry into Singapore**

Despite these measures, some foreign motorists continue to disregard their outstanding fines. To further deter such behaviour and more effectively enforce against those who fail to settle their fines, foreign vehicles with a number of outstanding fines for vehicle-related offences may be denied entry into Singapore from 1 April 2019.

To avoid being denied entry into Singapore, foreign motorists are strongly advised to check if they have any outstanding fines for vehicle-related offences, and settle them promptly. They may check this at [www.axs.com.sg](http://www.axs.com.sg). Payment for the fines can be made through the following channels (the full list of payment options is listed at [Annex](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2019/Feb/pr19-07a.pdf) ):

• AXS kiosks, AXS website and AXS mobile app
