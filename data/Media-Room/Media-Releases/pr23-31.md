  Published: 15 August 2023

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has released two residential sites at Clementi Avenue 1 and Pine Grove (Parcel B) for sale today under the second half 2023 (2H2023) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.   
  
The sites at Clementi Avenue 1 and Pine Grove (Parcel B) are launched for sale under the Confirmed List and can potentially yield about 500 and 565  residential units respectively. The total of 1,065 residential units from the two sites form part of the 5,160 residential units to be made available via the Confirmed List of the 2H2023 GLS programme. To cater to demand, the Government has ramped up the Confirmed List supply of private housing in the GLS programme, by 26% in 2H2023 compared to the preceding half year1. With the 2H2023 supply, the Confirmed List supply of around 9,250 units for the whole of 2023 will be at its highest level in a decade.
