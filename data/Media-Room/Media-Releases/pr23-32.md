The site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh is part of the increased housing supply under the 2H2023 Government Land Sales Programme to cater to demand. 

  Published: 05 September 2023

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has released a residential site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh for sale today under the second half 2023 (2H2023) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.   
  
The site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh is launched for sale under the Confirmed List and can potentially yield about 775 residential units. These form part of the 5,160 residential units to be made available via the Confirmed List of the 2H2023 GLS programme. To cater to demand, the Government has ramped up the Confirmed List supply of private housing in the GLS programme, by 26% in 2H2023 compared to the preceding half year. With the 2H2023 supply, the Confirmed List supply of around 9,250 units for the whole of 2023 will be at its highest level in a decade.
