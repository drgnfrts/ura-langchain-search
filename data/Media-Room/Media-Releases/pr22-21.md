**i Light Singapore,** Asia's leading sustainable light festival, will return for its eighth edition from 3 to 26 June 2022 after a two-year hiatus. Organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and presented by DBS, the Festival welcomes visitors to immerse in the creative artworks of professional and student artists that spark fresh perspectives on the environment and the world around us, while continuing to raise awareness on sustainability and inspire environmentally-friendly habits.

Starting this year, each edition of the Festival will be anchored on a colour from the visible light spectrum, which comprises different wavelengths to symbolise various ways of seeing and understanding the world. i Light Singapore 2022, themed , will be anchored by the colour violet – that has the shortest wavelength with the most powerful electromagnetic energy in the visible light spectrum. Violet is also a colour that signifies the awakening of the senses, akin to the spark of an idea in one's mind.  
  
In 2019, local and international artists had responded to an open call for artworks with creative interpretations, such as reimagining the potential of repurposing everyday objects and waste into delightful light installations. These artworks, together with several new ones, will be showcased at this year's Festival1, and aim to encourage conversations about our lifestyles and consumption behaviour to build a more sustainable future.  
  
Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA said, "The return of i Light Singapore will bring back buzz and vibrancy to the city centre, as Singapore progressively eases safe management measures and moves towards living with COVID-19. We hope this year's lineup of artworks and programmes will further invigorate Marina Bay and bring cheer and delight to festival-goers. At the same time, we hope that visitors will be encouraged to reflect on our individual relationships with the environment and with one another, such as how small but consistent changes to daily habits can contribute positively to the environment, and strengthen our relationships in a post-pandemic world."    
  
Shee Tse Koon, Singapore Country Head, DBS said, "We're excited to be the presenting sponsor of i Light Singapore 2022, which shares DBS's vision and commitment to raising awareness among the public to be more environmentally-conscious, and enabling them to take steps to create a more sustainable world for all. We believe that everyone has a part to play in this journey. Even the smallest changes in our everyday habits can go a long way – be it by cultivating a ‘zero waste' mindset when preparing meals, or being conscious consumers by shopping with social enterprises and businesses with positive impact at their core. It is our hope that the long-awaited i Light Singapore 2022 experience will not only stimulate festival-goers' visual senses and spark joy, but also inspire them to live more sustainable lifestyles."

One thought-provoking artwork is **_Alone Together_** by Singaporean artist **Ping Lim** and her American collaborator, **Ian Grossberg**, which features an interactive projection that captures our collective experience of living in isolation during the pandemic. The installation is inspired by the scenes of housing estates in Singapore, and captures vignettes of private moments that tell a story of people's lives when they were confined to their homes. Visitors are also invited to become part of this shared memory through real-time interaction using their own mobile phones.

Another highlight is **_Fallen_** by South Korean artist group **Nerdist x ARTINA**. This is a projection mapping artwork on a recycled transparent dome and bubble wrap that imagines the story of a jellyfish from space that crash-landed on Earth after consuming trash jettisoned into orbit by humans who ran out of disposal space. A play on the current plight of excessive waste as a by-product of consumerism, the artist hopes to remind visitors on the effect of their lifestyles on the environment.

Apart from the artworks, the Festival will also feature a series of other complementary programmes that promise a fun-filled and enriching experience for all. Over at the Lower Boardwalk at Marina Bay, visitors will be invited to embark on a specially constructed floating pontoon for a multi-sensory journey. At **Lightwave: Isle of Light,  empowered by OPPO**, visitors will traverse five unique zones with immersive features – from enchanting holographic projections, illuminated motion-capture graphics and shadows, to light beams that remind one of a mystical forest –  and be treated to a unique light art showcase that heralds new possibilities. Tickets to **_Lightwave: Isle of Light_** can be purchased from Klook from 5 May 20222.
