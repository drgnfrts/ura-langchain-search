The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has launched a residential site at Dunman Road for sale by public tender today under the Confirmed List of the first half 2022 (1H2022) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme. This site can potentially yield about 1,040 residential units. Details of the land parcel can be found in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2022/Mar/pr22-14a.pdf) .   
  
URA will also be removing a White site at Kampong Bugis from the 1H2022 Reserve List with immediate effect, due to delays in the completion of soil remediation works at the site. The Government will review the development staging plans for the Kampong Bugis site.
