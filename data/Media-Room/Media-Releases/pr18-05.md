The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) closed the tenders for three residential sites at  Chong Kuo Road, Handy Road and West Coast Vale today.

The sites at Chong Kuo Road and Handy Road were launched for public tender on 31 October 2017 and 30 November 2017 respectively. The site at West Coast Vale was originally on the Reserve List of the Government Land Sales Programme. URA had, on 4 December 2017, accepted a successful application for the site to be put up for sale and the site was released for sale on 19 December 2017. The three sites were offered for sale on 99-year lease terms.
