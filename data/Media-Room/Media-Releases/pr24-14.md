The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has released two residential sites at Canberra Crescent and De Souza Avenue for sale today under the first half 2024 (1H2024) Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.   
  
The two sites at Canberra Crescent and De Souza Avenue are launched for sale under the Confirmed List and can potentially yield about 730 residential units in total. These form part of the 5,450 residential units to be made available via the Confirmed List of the 1H2024 GLS programme. To cater to demand, the Government has increased the Confirmed List supply of private housing in the GLS programme to 5,450 units in 1H2024, from 4,090 units in 1H2023 and 5,160 units in 2H2023. This is the highest supply on the Confirmed List in a single GLS Programme since the 2H2013 GLS Programme.
