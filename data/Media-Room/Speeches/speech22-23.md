Good evening. I am delighted to join you in launching the 8th edition of i Light Singapore.  
  
We first held i Light Singapore in 2010, to introduce Marina Bay as a new live-work-play precinct right in the heart of our city. It marked a significant milestone in the transformation of our city.   
  
We had started planning for Marina Bay from the early 1970s, as a seamless extension of Singapore's Central Business District (CBD). Marina Bay is today a major financial and business hub – but also so much more. It is known for its distinctive architecture, waterfront promenade and welcoming public spaces along the perimeter of the Bay. Marina Bay is also a symbol of liveability, sustainability and innovation, with Gardens by the Bay, Marina Reservoir and Marina Barrage becoming popular public recreational spaces that we all love. And the underground District Cooling Network and Green Mark certified buildings reflect our commitment to sustainable development. We have been working together with stakeholders and the community over the years, to enliven the place with year-round activities.  
  
As a thriving People's Bay, Marina Bay demonstrates how a long-term and integrated planning approach can help shape a liveable and distinctive city.   
  
**Rejuvenating the city centre**   
  
But Marina Bay was much quieter in the past two years. We had to cancel signature events, including i Light Singapore, due to the pandemic. The city centre was particularly hard hit with work-from-home arrangements and social restrictions. At the same time, we grew to appreciate our parks, open spaces and local attractions a lot more.   
  
In these ways, the pandemic reminded us that we must plan for a liveable and people-centred city, and one that is resilient in an increasingly volatile and uncertain world.  
  
So we will build on our existing initiatives to improve the city centre. For instance, under URA's CBD Incentive Scheme, we encourage the conversion of older office buildings in selected CBD areas into mixed-use developments – which complements the shift towards more flexible working arrangements. Most recently, we have also worked with stakeholders to fully pedestrianise Connaught Drive and Anderson Bridge. This creates a greener environment in the Civic District, enabling more outdoor activities to enliven the area.    
  
We are also planning our city for the next 50 years and beyond, as part of the Long-Term Plan Review.   
  
As we bring jobs closer to homes and support new areas of economic growth, we will guide the development of the city centre based on the following strategies. We will continue to strengthen our CBD as an attractive global business and financial centre; monitor technological and socio-economic trends to calibrate the amount of office space needed; and rejuvenate the CBD as a vibrant district, by planning for more housing, mixed uses, public spaces, and streets for active mobility. These efforts will ensure that the city centre is not just a place to work, but also a vibrant place for people to live and play in.  
  
**Partnering widely to create more community-centric spaces**  
  
But making a city liveable and loveable goes beyond infrastructure plans. It is also about people coming together to steward our shared spaces, activate them, energise them, and bring them to life.   
  
And so I am deeply encouraged to see many business and community partners working together to make their precincts more vibrant. For example, the precincts under URA's pilot Business Improvement District (BID) programme, are beginning to stage larger and more creative events, as we emerge from the pandemic. One of them, the Marina Bay Alliance, is organising a drone event right here at Marina Bay, in conjunction with i Light Singapore. You can check out this experience at The Lawn beside Marina Bay Financial Centre, where you can race drones through visually stunning high-speed courses.    
  
The government is committed to supporting the community to enliven public spaces. On this note, I am pleased to announce that URA has reviewed our design guidelines, and will now be granting bonus Gross Floor Area (GFA) for Outdoor Refreshment Areas within more privately-owned public spaces.  
  
Previously, only developments in the Orchard Road and Singapore River planning areas were eligible for this bonus GFA. Now, all privately-owned public spaces can qualify. All developments that have maximised their development potential can propose new Outdoor Refreshment Areas within their public spaces, over the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan. We hope this will bring about even more meaningful public spaces, and better outdoor dining experiences for all to enjoy.   
  
**Return of i Light Singapore**   
  
Let me conclude by saying that I am very thrilled that we are bringing back i Light Singapore this year. It has become Asia's leading sustainable light festival, and a signature event that both locals and foreign visitors look forward to, with its creative and beautiful artworks by various professional and community partners.   
  
This year's festival features a line-up of 20 pieces by local and international artists, and a wide range of entertaining and enriching programmes. Many of the artworks explore important environmental issues – from the existential threat of climate change to the ways our lifestyles and habits impact the environment.  
  
It is wonderful to see Marina Bay lighting up once again in a sea of colours. This year's festival is especially meaningful, as it marks the start of our return to the liveliness that characterises the People's Bay. Beyond i Light Singapore, a wide range of events are being lined up in the coming months, so do look out for them.   
  
This year's i Light festival is made possible with the participation of artists from Singapore and 13 other countries, as well as key partners and sponsors. Thank you for your support and contribution to this event.   
  
I officially declare the festival open, and I wish everyone an enjoyable evening. Thank you.
