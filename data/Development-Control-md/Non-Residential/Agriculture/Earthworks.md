Earthworks

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.  
  
Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing
terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining
walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the
surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary,
shall be minimised.  
  
All earthworks (ie earth cut or earth fill) will require endorsement and
clearances from the lessor, SFA, and PUB.  
  
Planning permission is required if earthworks cause the level of any
point in the land to be more than 1.5 metres above the lower of the
following:

1.  the level of that point in the land at the time when the land was
    leased or agreed to be leased by the State or statutory body; or
2.  the level of any point at the abutting edge of abutting land

Earthworks on a smaller scale than the above may qualify for the
agriculture plan lodgment scheme.   
  
The digging of wells and ponds on agriculture land is authorised and do
not require planning permission.  
  
Earthworks are generally not encouraged, except in the following
circumstances:

-   <span style="color: #333333;">When the proposed earthworks are to
    match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;</span>
-   <span style="color: #333333;">When the sites are on undulating or
    sloping terrain, with large differences in platform levels within
    the site, or between the site and the road;</span>

#### Earthworks within the buildable area (ie outside the building setback area)

Earthworks within the buildable area of more than 1.5m are subject to
evaluation depending on merits.

#### Earthworks within the entire development site

<span style="color: #333333;">Earthfill involving the entire development
site may only be considered if the proposed earthworks are required to
meet the technical requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed
</span>up to PUB Minimum <span style="color: #333333;">Platform Level
(MPL)<sup><span style="padding: 0in; border: 1pt none windowtext;">1</span></sup> .</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup><span style="padding: 0in; border: 1pt none windowtext; color: #333333;">1</span></sup><span style="color: #333333;"></span>**<span style="padding: 0in; border: 1pt none windowtext; color: #333333;">Minimum
Platform Level (MPL)</span>**<span style="color: #333333;">: The minimum
1<sup><span style="padding: 0in; border: 1pt none windowtext;">st</span></sup> storey
level to be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the
Public Utilities Board (PUB).</span></span>

Retaining & Boundary Walls

*<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Agriculture/Allowable-Height-of-Retaining-and-Boundary-Walls.jpg>*

*Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.  
  
High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly
for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed,
they shall meet the following requirements:*  
*

-   <span style="color: #333333;">the height shall be less than
    1.5m;</span>
-   <span style="color: #333333;">retaining walls higher than 1.5m may
    be considered because of site constraints and the need for extensive
    excavation;</span>
-   <span style="color: #333333;">the total visible height of the solid
    boundary-cum-retaining wall shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the
    solid boundary wall shall not exceed 1.8m.</span>

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB
for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries
(except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with
drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as
these are transitory measures, pending the redevelopment of the
neighbouring land to the same MPL.
