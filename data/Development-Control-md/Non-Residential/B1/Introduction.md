### Introduction

Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses,
telecommunication and utility buildings. Depending on the nature of
their activities, clean and light industries are allowed in Business 1
(B1) zone. General and special industries are to be located in Business
2 (B2) zone.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 50m nuisance
buffer from a B1 zone to the surrounding area. Industrial activities
that require a nuisance buffer greater than 50m to the surrounding area
may not be located in B1 zone. The allowable types of industry or use
within industrial developments, based on NEAâ€™s nuisance buffer
requirements, are listed <a
