servicing of motor vehicles, tyre repairs and limited commercial uses.
All petrol stations shall adhere to their specific development
guidelines as follows:

Use Quantum

Petrol stations are primarily for the retail sale of fuel. Supporting or
ancillary office use may be allowed to serve the petrol station. Limited
commercial uses such as a mini-mart may be allowed in petrol stations
for some convenience shopping to motorists. Preparation, processing and
cooking of food are not allowed. All supporting or ancillary uses in a
petrol station are subject to the following requirements:

-   Commercial spaces shall not exceed 15% of the total proposed GFA or
    150sqm, whichever is lower. The actual quantum allowable shall be
    subject to planning consideration depending on the location, site
    condition, site context, impact on the surrounding area and
    requirements of other government agencies.
-   Ancillary offices, stores, and compressor rooms shall not exceed 10%
    of the total proposed GFA. Mechanical repair bays may be considered
    if the petrol station is located outside of the Water Catchment
    Area.
