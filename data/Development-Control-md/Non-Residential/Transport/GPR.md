### Gross Plot Ratio

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) is subject to evaluation, taking
into consideration the location, site context, topography, traffic
situation, impact of the Transport development on the surroundings and
other agencies’ requirements.

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage
reserve<sup>1</sup> (DR) and/or road reserve<sup>2</sup> (RR) to be
vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the
gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

<sup>1</sup> **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes
of building or widening a public drain

<sup>2</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
