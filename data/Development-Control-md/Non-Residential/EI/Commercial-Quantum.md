### Commercial Quantum

For institutions of higher learning (universities, polytechnics) such as
SIM, NAFA, LASALLE and INSEAD, the maximum (upper bound) allowable
commercial use is 5% of the total proposed GFA or 30,000sqm, whichever
is lower.

Examples of commercial uses within EI developments include food courts,
restaurants, cafes, book & stationery shops, hair salons, minimarts,
banks, travel agencies, medical clinics, student-run businesses.
