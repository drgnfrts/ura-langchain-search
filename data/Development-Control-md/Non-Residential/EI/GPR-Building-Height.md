Gross Plot Ratio and Storey Height

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) and number of storeys for the EI
shall take into account the character of the surrounding area. As a
guide, depending on the allowable GPR, the corresponding number of
storeys are shown in the table below. The actual number of storeys
allowed may vary, or be higher, depending on the site topography, site
condition and the context of the surrounding area. 

Basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any
side shall be counted as a storey.

For redevelopment of an existing approved EI or to carry out major
extensions to it, the proposed increase in GPR or GFA is subject to
planning consideration taking into account the location of the EI,
context of the surrounding area and requirements of other government
agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first before
commencement of works.

Overall Building Height

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height<sup>1</sup> of EI
developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).

<sup>1</sup> Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

Floor-to-Floor Height

The maximum floor-to-floor height of EI developments is 5.0m.

Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

*Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys*

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace
areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate. 

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7
storeys, EI developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building
height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table
below:

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky
terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located
directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional
height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

1.  Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National
    Monuments;
2.  Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3.  Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block
    plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject
to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in
<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design"
target="_blank">urban design areas</a> with site-specific height
considerations.
