Submission of WCP

BPs with expected high pedestrian and cyclist traffic are required to
provide a WCP as part of the Development Application. As a guide,
development types listed in the table below are subject to WCP
requirement.

Developments not listed in the table above may also be required to
submit a WCP if they fall under the following criteria:

-   Developments located in car-lite precincts<sup>4</sup>; or
-   Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, ie within
    Zone 2<sup>5</sup>; or
-   Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.

Applicants of developments meeting the above criteria are strongly
encouraged to check in early with LTA for the requirement of a WCP. See
the diagram below for the submission flowchart to LTA and URA.

*Submission Flowchart*

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> Developments that have a
master developer, and consist of two or more plots that staged at
different time will also be required to submit a WCP at the concept
design stage. </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>2</sup> LTA and URA will work with
HDB on the WCP requirements.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>3</sup> Only industrial developments
located within car-lite precincts or 400m of major transport nodes ie
within Zone 2, will be required to submit a WCP.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>4</sup> The five car-lite precincts
are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District, Kampong Bugis, Marina South and
Woodlands North.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>5</sup> Zone 2 as defined in the
Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code of Practice on Vehicle Parking
Provision in Development proposals. Please refer to <a
href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html"

Design of WCP

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of
pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the
design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public
    transport facilities and adjacent developments;
-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians,
    cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular
    ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;
-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking
    spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and
    lockers;
-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and
    amenities for cyclists; and
-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly
    and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are
summarised in LTA’s Code of Practice <a
href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html"
target="_blank">“Street Work Proposals Relating to Development
Works”</a>.

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related
infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide
has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies’ prevailing
COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded
<a
