handbook for the various development control parameters will generally
be applied by URA in the consideration of a development application.
However, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations
relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in its discretion decide to
depart from these general guidelines. Persons intending to carry out a
development are advised to take this into consideration in the conduct
of their affairs and check with URA through enquiries or development
applications to confirm if their proposals can be allowed.<br />
<br />
The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.</span> <strong></strong></td>
