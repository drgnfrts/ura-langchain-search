### Gross Plot Ratio

The guideline on the allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for new Civic and
Community Institution (C&CI) developments shall take into account the
character of the surrounding area. The allowable GPR in the table below
is the upper bound. The actual allowable GPR would depend on site
conditions, traffic situation, impact of the C&CI development on the
nearby developments and other agencies’ requirements.

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage
reserve<sup>1</sup> (DR) and/or road reserve<sup>2</sup> (RR) to be
vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the
gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

<sup>1</sup> **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes
of building or widening a public drain

<sup>2</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

*GPR for sites where vesting is required*

For redevelopment of existing approved C&CI developments or to carry out
major extensions to them, the proposed increase in GPR or Gross Floor
Area (GFA) is subject to planning consideration taking into account the
location of the development, context of the surrounding area and
requirements of other government agencies. Planning approval from URA
shall be obtained first before commencement of works.
