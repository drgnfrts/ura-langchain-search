incentive schemes if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

Community and Sports Facilities Scheme

The Community and Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS) facilitates the
co-location of compatible community and sports uses with highly
accessible commercial developments. Under the CSFS, bonus GFA for the
community and sports uses is subject to an overall cap of 10% of the
maximum permissible GFA for the site allowed under the prevailing Master
Plan or 2,000sqm (whichever is lower).

<a href="#Eligibility-CSFS" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-parent="#CSFS1" data-toggle="collapse"></a>

#### Eligible Commercial Developments

The co-location of community or sports uses under the CSFS is intended
primarily for commercial retail developments which are highly
accessible. The commercial development that may be considered for the
community and/or sports uses under the CSFS shall be in close proximity
to transport nodes or town centres/neighbourhood centres, and the
additional CSFS space may be supported from the land use and transport
planning points of view.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS would not be supported in hotel
developments as the resultant synergies are limited.

Community and sports uses under the CSFS in office developments shall
only be considered if it is clear that the use has clear synergies with
the office development and caters to the needs of the office workers.

The proposed community and sports uses shall primarily be intended for
public or community use and not profit-driven, with the exception of
commercial child care centres endorsed by the Early Development
Childhood Agency (ECDA). Refer to table below for a list of allowable

Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage
adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM)
outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The
incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may
qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of
the development proposal.

<sup>1</sup>Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be
considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable
productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development
proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the
developers.

<sup>2</sup><span style="text-align: justify;">The maximum allowable
number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of
Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity,
which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.</span>

<a href="#Quantum-of-bonus-GFA-allowed" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-parent="#Built-Environment-Transformation-Scheme1"
data-toggle="collapse"></a>

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

<span style="color: #000000;">Private sites may be granted up to 3%
bonus GFA under the scheme<sup>3</sup>. The scheme is applicable for new
proposals till 23 November 2026. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA.
The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.
</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept
within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio
(GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not
form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. 
</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under
the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum
that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional
requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus
GFA. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Should development proposals fall within
areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height
controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity
due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus
GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower
than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a
particular use or uses.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<sup>3</sup>Applications submitted under the Strategic Development
Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes
will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of
digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM
outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the
proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI
development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for
planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive
scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under
the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.
