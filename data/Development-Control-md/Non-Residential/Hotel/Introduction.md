### Introduction

Hotel developments, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are
primarily public accommodation facilities for commercial purpose. While
Hotels are predominantly used as accommodation, other limited supporting
commercial uses such as shops, restaurants and bars may be allowed.

Only the commercial use component within a hotel development may be
strata subdivided.

Backpackers’ hostels, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are also
public accommodation facilities for commercial purpose. They are open
concept dormitories for boarding and lodging purposes, with a minimum of
6 beds per room. Refer <a
