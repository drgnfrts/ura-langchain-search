*Building Height*

The overall building height for hotel developments are determined by the
number of storeys and the prescribed floor-to-floor height.

Number of Storeys

The number of storeys for hotel developments is guided by the
<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=BH"
target="_blank">building height plan</a>.

If the storey height is not specified in the building height plan, the
number of storeys would be evaluated by taking into consideration the
location, site context, site topography, and impact of the hotel
development on the surroundings.

Basement storeys that protrude more than 1.0m above ground level on any
side shall be counted as a storey.

Floor-to-Floor Height & Aggregate Building Height

*Floor-to-floor height for Hotel developments*

The maximum floor-to-floor height for hotel developments is 5m,
including mezzanine floor.

Variations in floor-to-floor height are subject to evaluation depending
on the use and location of the floor. If permitted, the proposed
building height shall not exceed the maximum building height control
computed based on the permitted number of storeys.

Overall Building Height Control

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height<sup>1</sup> of
hotel developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA). 

<sup>1</sup> Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey

*Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys*

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace
areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate. 

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7
storeys, hotel developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building
height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table
below:

The additional building height can only be distributed to the sky
terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located
directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional
height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

1.  Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National
    Monuments;
2.  Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or
3.  Developments with special controls e.g. areas with street block
    plans.

In addition to (a) – (c), any additional building height will be subject
to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings or in
<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design"
target="_blank">urban design areas</a> with site-specific height
considerations.
