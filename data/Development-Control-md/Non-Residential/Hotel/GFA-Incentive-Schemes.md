### Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes

Hotel developments are eligible for bonus GFA if they satisfy the
requirements of the following incentive schemes:

### 

<a href="#Balcony-Incentive-Scheme" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-toggle="collapse"></a>

Balcony Incentive Scheme

The GFA of balconies in hotel developments may be computed over and
above the Master MP allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 10% inclusive of
planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony
GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon
redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may be subject to SLA levying
Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When submitting development
proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony
area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area
that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.

Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity
may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 10% of
the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This
does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height or
use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master
Plan, Building Height Plan or Special and Detailed Control Plan.

Balcony designs shall adhere to the following guidelines and submission
requirements:

<br />
<em>Balcony Perimeter Opening</em><br />
<br />
The portions of a balcony that face a parapet wall (eg a wall between
the balconies of two adjoining units) not exceeding 1.3m in height are
considered “open”.<br />
<br />
The QP shall show the computation of perimeter opening for the proposed
balconies on the floor plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="background-color: #f2f2f2"><strong>Screen</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Balconies shall not be enclosed with walls or glass panels as
balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. Balcony screens may can
be allowed provided:
<ul>
<li>The balcony screens can be drawn open or retracted fully; and</li>
<li>The balcony screens allow for natural ventilation/air flow within
the balcony at all times, even when the screens are fully drawn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Balcony screens shall be designed upfront and approved as part of
the Development Application process for all new hotel developments with
proposed balconies (including the hotel component of mixed-use
developments). Developers may propose a single screen design or a few
designs.</li>
<li>Developers shall provide a Letter of Undertaking to be submitted at
the Development Application Stage, downloadable via the following <a

<li>The plans shall show the balcony screens in elevation view; one view
fully retracted and another view fully closed with a fully retracted
view in a plan view. The porosity of the balcony screen shall be
annotated, and if the screening is louvred, the individual slats shall
be fixed (ie not adjustable). Section cuts of the louvres shall be
provided to show that the screening is naturally ventilated at all
times, even when closed.</li>
<li>For existing developments without balcony screens, screens may be
installed provided they fulfil the performance criteria above. Safety
grilles are not considered as balcony screens, and such installation
does not require planning approval.</li>

Built Environment Transformation Scheme

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage
adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM)
outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The
incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may
qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of
the development proposal. 

<a href="#BE-Eligibility" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-parent="#Built-Environment-Transformation-Scheme1"
data-toggle="collapse"></a>

#### Eligibility

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition &
Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA<sup>1</sup>. Sites
launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31
March 2022 may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<sup>1</sup>Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be
considered on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable
productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development
proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the
developers.

<sup>2</sup><span style="text-align: justify;">The maximum allowable
number of dwelling units for residential developments located outside of
Central Area is derived from the Master Plan permissible intensity,
which excludes any bonus GFA the site is eligible for.</span>

<a href="#Quantum-of-bonus-GFA-allowed" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-parent="#Built-Environment-Transformation-Scheme1"
data-toggle="collapse"></a>

#### Quantum of bonus GFA allowed

<span style="color: #000000;">Private sites may be granted up to 3%
bonus GFA under the scheme<sup>3</sup>. The scheme is applicable for new
proposals till 23 November 2026. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA.
The scheme is applicable for new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.
</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept
within the overall budget of 10% above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio
(GPR), or the maximum allowable GFA of the development. It shall not
form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. 
</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under
the BE Transformation Scheme is based on the proposed uses, use quantum
that complies with the Master Plan zoning, and any additional
requirements imposed as part of the endorsement for the bonus
GFA. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Should development proposals fall within
areas with specific planning considerations (e.g. storey height
controls) or are unable to fully accommodate the additional intensity
due to on-site conditions (e.g. areas with traffic concerns), the bonus
GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme that can be approved may be lower
than the endorsed quantum, and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a
particular use or uses.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<sup>3</sup>Applications submitted under the Strategic Development
Incentive (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes
will have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of
digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM
outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of the
proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the SDI/CBDI
development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as conditions for
planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the SDI/CBD Incentive
scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for the additional GFA under
the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme.

 

<a href="#BE-Submission" class="collapsible collapsed"
data-parent="#Built-Environment-Transformation-Scheme1"

#### Submission

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents
on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM
outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can
be made at this <a href="https://form.gov.sg/610112199bdc0c00123abb25"
target="_blank">link</a>. 

Following BCA’s grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit
the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the
proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment.
The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from
BCA’s grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the
Letter of Acceptance, and the <a
href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/BE-Transformation-GFA-computation-form.pdf"
target="_blank">BE Transformation GFA computation form</a>. The

ORA within Privately-Owned Public Spaces (POPS)

Hotel developments may make use of any combination of the bonus GFA
incentive schemes (ie Balcony Incentive Scheme and Rooftop ORA on
Landscaped Roofs), as long as the cumulative bonus GFA does not exceed
the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.

The bonus GFA allowed under the bonus incentive schemes is over and
above the MP GPR and is subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When
the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under
the bonus GFA incentive schemes cannot be carried over. In other words,
the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing
MP.
