Computation to the Middle of External Walls

GFA is computed to the middle of external walls<sup>1</sup> (excluding
the thickness of wall finishes). See illustration below.

Where there are windows or doors along the external wall, GFA is
likewise computed to the middle of these windows or doors. See
illustration below.

*<span style="color: gray;">Example of GFA demarcation for windows along

Where there are other vertical structures (e.g. railings, parapet walls,
curtain walls) in-lieu of external walls, GFA will be computed to the
middle of the outermost vertical structures. See examples below.

There is no need to account for columns, and GFA will continue to be
computed to the middle of the external walls.

Where there is a change in wall thickness, a 50mm offset is used to
connect the different GFA delineations.

Where there is no external wall or similar vertical structure, GFA will
be computed up to the edge of the covered areas.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/75-GFA-cross-section-computation-without-wall-or-vertical-structure28Jul2023SC-03-bay-window-and-bal.jpg?h=500&w=800>

Where a wall is between a GFA space and space that is not computed as
GFA (e.g. shop space and common carpark) the extent of the GFA space
will be computed to the middle of the wall. See example (A) below.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/76-GFA-cross-section-computation-between-GFA-and-exempted-space28Jul2023SC-03-bay-window-and-balcony.jpg?h=500&w=800><span style="text-align: left;"></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup><span style="line-height: 115%;">For
buildings with party walls, which refer to the shared wall along the
common boundary of two separate developments, GFA computation will

building</span></span>

<a href="#StrataGFA" class="collapsible collapsed"

All Strata Areas to be computed as GFA

All proposed strata areas will be computed as GFA. For example, if an AC
ledge serving a residential unit is included as part of the strata area
of the unit, the AC ledge will be computed as GFA.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/77-GFA-Example-of-GFA-and-strata-demarcation-in-AC-ledge.jpg?h=500&w=800>

*<span style="line-height: 115%; color: gray;">Example of GFA and strata
demarcation in AC ledge</span>*

QPs are to clearly reflect both the GFA and strata boundaries on each of
the floor plans submitted to URA, and to ensure all proposed strata
areas have been duly computed as GFA. Non-provision of strata boundaries
may result in a delay in URA’s grant of approval.

Developers are strongly encouraged to involve surveyors early in the
design process to firm up the proposed strata boundaries. This is
because any proposed changes to strata boundaries downstream may affect
the resultant GFA of the development. If this results in the proposed
GFA exceeding the Master Plan control, URA will require the proposed GFA
to be rectified (e.g. via an amendment application) before strata
subdivision approval can be granted.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exceptions where strata area
need not be computed as GFA</span>**

There are some developments (e.g. mixed-use developments) where spaces
intended for public/ communal use are included as part of a larger
strata area, for the purpose of demarcating ownership and maintenance
responsibilities. For example, covered walkways on the 1<sup>st</sup>
storey commercial floor, within a larger commercial/residential
development or sky terraces on the upper hotel floor, within a larger
hotel/office mixed-use development.

<span style="line-height: 115%;">Such spaces can continue to be
considered for GFA exemption (notwithstanding their inclusion as strata
area), subject to compliance with URA’s prevailing guidelines for GFA
exemptions.</span>

GFA Apportionment

If the approved development comprises more than one use, the following
rules shall apply in the calculation of common areas. Such a mixed
development may also arise due to the land use zone, for example the
Commercial & Residential zone.

**Attributable space: **Where a common area is exclusively used for a
specific purpose, it will be apportioned to the specific use. See
example below.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72A-Apportionment_Comm_2oct20.jpg> 

**Non-attributable space**: Where the common area is used for two or
more purposes, it will be apportioned based on the weighted average,
pegged to the prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning of
the development. See example below.

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/GFA/GFA-72B-Apportionment-CommResi_2oct20.jpg>

The new apportionment rules will be applied on a per floor basis. If a
floor is occupied by a single use (e.g. Commercial), any vertical
circulation GFA areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned
to Commercial use, though they may also be used by other users (e.g.
Residential) above for escape purposes.  However, if the floor is
occupied by two or more uses<sup>1</sup> for which the staircase GFA on
that floor cannot be exclusively attributed, they will be regarded as
non-attributable space and apportioned based on weighted average, pegged
to the prescribed use quantum in the Master Plan zoning. 

The illustrations above are not exhaustive in covering all possible
building or layout designs. In evaluating the development applications,
URA may, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations
relevant to a case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration and check with URA through enquiries or development
applications to confirm the application of the rules on their proposals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup>These should comprise actual
uses and not common areas. For example, on full Commercial floors with
lift lobbies that serve Hotel uses, vertical circulation areas like
staircases on that floor will be apportioned to Commercial use. 
However, on mixed floors with both Hotel and Shop uses, vertical
circulation areas will be apportioned based on weighted average.</span>

GFA Apportionment for Sites with Specific Use Quantum Mix in Tender/
Lease Conditions

For sites where the tender or lease conditions state that the land is to
be developed for a certain use quantum mix, non-attributable common
areas will be apportioned based on the specific use quantum mix stated
in the tender or lease conditions, rather than the Master Plan zoning.
For example, if the lease conditions for a site zoned Commercial require
that the site is to be developed for a use quantum mix of 65% Commercial
and 35% Civic & Community Institution, the non-attributable spaces will
be apportioned based on 65% Commercial and 35% Civic & Community
Institution, rather than 100% Commercial. 

For White sites where the tender or lease conditions stipulate a minimum
quantum control on a particular use (e.g. minimum 30% Service
Apartment), this will be taken into account when apportioning the
non-attributable common areas with the balance 70% distributed to the
other uses in the development on a simple average basis. For example, if
the White site has a requirement of minimum 30% Service Apartment use
and the development also has Commercial and Hotel uses, the
apportionment of the non-attributable common areas will be based on 30%
Service Apartment, 35% Commercial and 35% Hotel.     

In evaluating the development applications, URA may, if the
circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a
case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons intending to carry out
a development are advised to take this into consideration and check with
URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm the
application of the rules on their proposals.

Re-computation of GFA for Existing Developments

Prior to 1 Sep 1989, the intensity of residential developments was
determined using the population density (i.e. persons per hectare)
method while that for commercial developments was based on the nett
floor area method (i.e. excluding neutral areas). With effect from 1 Sep
1989, the different methods of determining development intensity for
different types of development were standardised by the current Gross
Floor Area (GFA) method.  
  
To determine the intensity of such developments approved before 1 Sep
1989, there is a need to convert the approved GFA of the developments to
the standardised current GFA definition. For such developments, the
approved building would need to be recomputed based on the prevailing
GFA definition.

As for developments approved after 1 September 1989, the intensity of
these developments are already determined using the modern GFA system.
Therefore, there is no need to recompute the GFA for such developments.
