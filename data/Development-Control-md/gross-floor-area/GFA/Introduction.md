### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px;">For development control purpose,
Singapore uses a Gross Floor Area (GFA) system to work out the bulk and
intensity of a development. The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for a specific
development site is defined as the ratio of the GFA of a building to its
site or plot
area<sup>[<span style="color: #000000;">1</span>](#section1)</sup> . The
allowable GPR of a development is guided by the GPR specified in the
Master Plan (MP).   
  
This GFA handbook explains which area or space of a development is
included or excluded from GFA for development control purpose. As a
general principle, all (a) covered floor area of a development, (b)
uncovered area used for commercial purposes, and (c) strata area
(covered or otherwise) of a development are included as GFA, unless
otherwise exempted. This is regardless of whether the spaces are
accessible or usable.   
  
GFA is the total area of covered floor space, including the half
thickness of external
walls<sup>[<span style="color: #000000;">2</span>](#section2)</sup> or
other building facade elements (e.g. windows, railings, curtain walls),
but excluding voids.     
</span>

 

**<span style="font-size: 24px;">Bonus Gross Floor Area above MP
Allowable Intensity</span>**

<span style="font-size: 18px;">Bonus GFA is allowed over and above the
MP GPR subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is
redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the GFA
incentive schemes shall not be carried over. In other words, the GPR for
the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.  
  
Although a site may make use of multiple GFA incentive schemes, the
total GFA shall not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.
Developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes
if they comply with the relevant guidelines: </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> The area of a site/plot
measured between the survey boundary lines. If there are area(s) of the
land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve or Street/Road
Reserve to be vested to the State, these areas may be included in the
site area for GPR calculation. Once these areas are vested to the State,
they cannot be used for GPR calculation subsequently.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>2</sup> For buildings with party
walls, which refer to the shared wall along the common boundary of two
separate developments, GFA computation will include the thickness of the
party wall that is part of the building.</span>
