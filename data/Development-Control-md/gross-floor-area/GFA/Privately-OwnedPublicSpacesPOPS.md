Configuration</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: windowtext;">The public space area should be
large enough to improve the amenity of the local area and serve as a
meaningful space for users. As a guide, the public space area should be
at least:-</span>
<ul>
<li>1sqm of public space area for every 50sqm of total development GFA;
or</li>
<li>25% of the development's building footprint. (whichever is
lower)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span>Covered public spaces should have high volume of at least two
storeys or an appropriate height in proportion to its size.</span></li>
<li><span>At least 75% of the total public space area should consist of
a contiguous space which is regular in shape, subject to detailed
evaluation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access and
Location</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: windowtext;">The public space should be located
at the first storey with a frontage onto a major street or pedestrian
thoroughfare.</span></li>
<li><span>The public space frontage should be open and unobstructed to
allow for easy pedestrian access and be highly visible from the
adjoining street or pedestrian thoroughfare.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The access and circulation within the public space should be
barrier-free and comply with BCA’s universal design
guidelines.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Seating and
Amenities</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Public seating should be provided. The minimum requirement is
one seat per 20sqm of public space area (1m of bench/ledge = 2
seats).</span></li>
<li><span>A variety of seating to cater to different users, age groups
and physical abilities is encouraged, e.g. seats with back and arm rests
are highly encouraged to cater to the elderly; movable seats to allow
for interaction, etc.</span></li>
<li><span>The public space may include other amenities to encourage
public use of the space such as:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Design Features: Public Art, Water Features;</span></li>
<li><span>Furniture + Equipment: Tables, Play/Exercise Equipment,
Built-in Lighting and Audio Equipment for events; and</span></li>
<li><span>Services: Drinking Fountains, Wi-Fi Connection, Phone Charging
Points.</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shade</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The public space should be well shaded to encourage public use
throughout the day.</span></li>
<li><span>Shade can be provided by integration within the building form,
by adjacent buildings, trees, canopies/pergolas, adjustable
umbrellas/awnings, and/or landscape elements.</span></li>
<li><span>The material used to provide shade must not result in
additional heat retention in the public space.</span></li>
<li><span>Sun shadow study should be undertaken to demonstrate that
sufficient shade is provided between 9:00am and 4:00pm. Shadow diagrams
are to be studied for shadow cast on 21 Jun: at 9:00am, 12:00pm and
4:00pm. For each shadow diagram:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>At least 50% of the total public space area is to be shaded;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></span></li>
<li><span>At least 50% of public space seating is be shaded.</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signage</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>An information plaque shall be installed at a visible and
fixed location near the main entrance of the public space.</span></li>
<li><span>The plaque should include the following information:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Public Open Space logo measuring at least 30 cm by 30
cm;</span></li>
<li><span>“Open to public 24 hours” statement;</span></li>

(editable in Adobe Illustrator) and high resolution logo

<li><span>All text on the signage should be highly contrasting with the
background colour of the sign, at least 20mm in height, and in a highly
legible font.</span></li>
<li><span>The signage must be constructed of highly durable material
such as metal or stone that is fully opaque and
non-reflective.</span></li>

<ul>
<li><span>Designed as outdoor, <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">unenclosed</span> dining
areas</span>;</li>
<li><span>Umbrellas, retractable canopies and lightweight structures are
allowed</span>;</li>
<li><span>Only loose tables, chairs and approved structures by relevant
authorities are allowed;</span></li>
<li><span>All furniture or opaque structures should not exceed 1.2m
high;</span></li>
<li><span>The extent of the ORAs is to be clearly demarcated with
boundary markers which are not easily removable e.g. planters. All
structures and furniture, including menu stands, displays and signage,
must not encroach beyond the extent of the approved ORA.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outdoor Kiosk for food
preparation</span></p>
<p><span>Outdoor kiosk for food preparation can be allowed within the
ORA boundary if they comply with the following guidelines:-</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ancillary food preparation area up to 30sqm. Larger food
preparation areas may be considered on a case-by-case, subject to
evaluation</span>;</li>
<li><span>No major food preparation is allowed</span>;</li>
<li><span>All furniture or opaque panels, including doors and internal
partitions should not exceed 1.2m high</span>;</li>
<li><span>Up to 4m width, with an additional 1m return, of the
lightweight structure (if any) can be walled with full height opaque
panels to conceal equipment and storage. A wider width may be considered
on a case-by-case basis, subject to evaluation;</span></li>
<li><span>Designed as contiguous with the seating area;</span></li>
<li><span>For proposals in which an ORA within POPS is integrated with
an Outdoor Kiosk for food preparation, the combined seating area and the
Outdoor Kiosk should not exceed 150sqm.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signage</span></p>
<p><span>Business names are allowed to be displayed on the awnings /
structures.  Any third-party advertisement signs or sponsor logos are
not allowed as freestanding structures or to be displayed on the ORA
structures. Any signs will require the written approval of Building and
Construction Authority (BCA) prior to the installations.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gross Floor Area</span></p>
<p><span>ORA within POPS will be considered as commercial
GFA.</span></p>
<p><span>For developments which have maximised their development
potential, the proposed ORA within POPS can be considered over and above
the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan for the site,
subject to the overall 10% GFA bonus cap<sup>[1]</sup> for each
development and the payment of Land Betterment Charge as assessed by
SLA.</span></p>
<p><span>As per current practice, all additional GFA granted under the
bonus GFA incentive schemes will not form the future development
potential of the site upon redevelopment.</span></p>
