### Building Appendages

-   All structures shall generally be confined within the envelope. The
    car porch and patio/terrace area are subject to the setback
    guidelines shown in the <a
    href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Setbacks-from-boundaries"
    target="_blank">Building Setbacks</a> section.
-   Minor building appendages that do not increase the building bulk may
    be allowed to encroach slightly into the road buffer and setback
    areas, as shown in the table below. While the building appendages
    may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may
    require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure
    that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
-   Allowable protrusion into the setbacks for other building appendages
    not covered in the table shall be assessed on the merits of the
    proposal.

Car Porch

The height of the car porch shall not exceed 4.5m.

The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall
remain open-to-sky and unenclosed.

The required setback for the accessible car porch roof area, when used
as open balcony/ garden from the common boundaries, shall follow the
requisite side/rear setbacks of the main building.

Where one side of the car porch abuts the neighbour’s boundary, a 1.8m
high light-weight screen wall shall be built along the common boundary
of the car porch roof to provide the neighbour with some privacy, unless
the adjoining neighbour agrees to do without the screen wall. Examples
of light-weight screens include angled louvres or slanted vertical
panels.

Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:

-   A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch
    roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and
    railing);
-   A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building
    wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch
    roof;
-   Planters for landscaping.

***Note**:*

-   If the plot abuts a GCBA plot, the minimum setback is 3m.
-   These standards are based on Cat 3-5 roads. Setback requirement for
    other building features not covered under the table shall be
    assessed on the merits of the proposal.
