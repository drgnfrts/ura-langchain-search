### Gross Plot Ratio

The development potential of a residential development is guided by the
Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) specified in the Master Plan (MP). The MP plot
ratio is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of
site limitations like shape of the plot, site topography or ground
conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements
of other authorities that may affect the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage
reserve<sup>1</sup> (DR) and/or road reserve<sup>2</sup> (RR) to be
vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the
Gross Floor Area (GFA) for a GPR.

<sup>1</sup> **Drainage Reserve**<span style="font-size: 16px;">: An
area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public
drain.</span>

<sup>2</sup> **Street/Road Reserve**<span style="font-size: 16px;">: The
plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street
Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line
Plan and the site boundary. </span>
