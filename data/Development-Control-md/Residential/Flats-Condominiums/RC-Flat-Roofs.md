### RC Flat Roofs

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes
only<sup>1</sup>. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces
and landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the
proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by
URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall
comply with height controls<sup>2</sup> and
the<span style="text-align: justify;"> following</span> guidelines.

<sup>1</sup> RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for
maintenance purposes only are subject to agencies’ requirements for
safety barriers to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety
barriers shall not exceed 1m in height.

<sup>2</sup> Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints<sup>@</sup> (e.g. Aviation
    paths restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available
    at <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)
-   Urban design height controls (available
    at <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)

<sup>@</sup> The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height
Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the
other height controls.

Communal Pavilions

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that
function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal
pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be
computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 50sqm<sup>1</sup> or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is
    lower.
-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height
    control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed
    externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an
    additional storey.
-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height
    or are not located within areas subject to storey height control,
    maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be
    allowed.
-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The
    greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building
    users and visible from the surroundings.
-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken
    planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of
    plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision of
    communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.
-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces
    containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping
    scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth, communal
    facilities, shall be submitted with the Development Application.

<sup>1</sup> The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to
the roof eaves line. <span style="line-height: 115%;">If attached to the
main building, the area excludes the adjoining walls.</span>

Solar Panels

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if
they meet the following criteria:

1.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the
    horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and
    minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and
2.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of
    any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and
    High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the
solar panel system does not require planning permission except in
locations and contexts described below.

#### Planning Permission

1.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation
    Areas<sup>2</sup> shall require planning permission due to their
    impact on the roofscape.  
    **  
    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>2</sup> For Conservation Areas,
    installation of solar panels without any additional works are
    treated as localised works for the purpose of repair and maintenance
    and are considered Category 3 works for Conserved Buildings.
    Applications for such Category 3 works can be made by owners and
    contractors. Refer to the Conservation Guidelines
    <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation"
    target="_blank">here</a> and information on submission procedure <a
    href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Additions-Alterations/Types-Works"
    target="_blank">here</a>.</span>

<!-- -->

1.  **Elevated solar panels<sup>3</sup> located in developments on the
    following land use zones shall require planning permission:**

<sup>3</sup> A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more
than 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from
the roof level for other developments.

1.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use  
    **  
    Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated
    or non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses
    such as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces
    shall be computed as GFA.

#### Assessment of Storey Height

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed
as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they
comply with the guidelines below:
