Balconies

The GFA of balconies in flats and condominium developments may be
computed over and above the Master Plan (MP) allowable GPR, subject to a
cap of 7% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may
only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development
potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may
be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When
submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to
demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare
the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.

Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity
may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 7% of
the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This
does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height or
use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master
Plan, Building Height Plan or Special and Detailed Control Plan. For
instance, a flats development within a designated landed housing area
shall not qualify for the bonus balcony GFA.

<span style="color: #000000;">To qualify for the additional GPR only for
use as balcony, the
balcony </span><span style="text-align: justify;">designs shall adhere
to the following guidelines and submission requirements:</span>

Private Enclosed Spaces (PES)

A Private Enclosed Space refers to a semi-outdoor area adjacent to a
strata unit. It forms part of the private strata area of units which are
sold to homeowners.

All PES in non-landed residential developments shall be counted as GFA
under the 7% maximum bonus GFA allowed beyond the Master Plan (MP)
stipulated GPR. PES approved before 12 January 2013 may not be counted
towards the development’s GFA.

To qualify for the bonus GFA scheme, PES shall comply with the
guidelines to retain a semi-outdoor character. The structures shall
comply with the relevant requirements from technical agencies.

The guidelines for PES are in the table below.

process. Developers may propose a single cover design, or a few designs
for the homeowners to choose from.</li>
<li>Developers shall install a 2m wide (minimum) cover from the external
wall. Homeowners shall be given the flexibility and choice over the
remaining cover for the rest of the PES beyond 2m, as long as it is one

installation. MCSTs may use these pre-approved designs to guide
homeowners who wish to extend their cover beyond 2m.</li>

adjoining PES may be allowed if they are to meet FSSD’s
requirements.</td>

Private Roof Terraces (PRT)

A Private Roof Terrace refers to a semi-outdoor area located at the roof
level of a strata unit. It forms part of the private strata area of
units which are sold to homeowners. To avoid complications at the
strata-subdivision stage, these should be clearly annotated as ‘Private
Roof Terraces’.

All PRT of developments shall be counted as GFA under the 7% maximum
bonus GFA allowed beyond the Master Plan (MP) stipulated GPR. PRT
approved before 12 January 2013 may not be counted towards the
development’s GFA.

To qualify for the bonus GFA scheme, PRT shall comply with the
guidelines to retain a semi-outdoor character. The structures shall
comply with the relevant requirements from technical agencies.

The guidelines for PRT are in the table below.

Communal roof terraces are open to sky areas managed by the MCST which
serve to provide landscaping and communal facilities for residents in
the development. They shall not be counted as GFA. Covered or enclosed
features within these areas shall be counted as GFA.

<sup>1</sup> **Springing Line**: The line joining the points on which
the roof rests.

Indoor Recreation Spaces

Private non-landed residential developments and the residential
component of mixed-use developments may apply for the communal indoor
recreation spaces to be counted as bonus GFA, provided such spaces are
more than 0.6% of the total GFA of the development or 10sqm (whichever
is higher). The bonus GFA shall be capped at 1% of total GFA, or the GFA
of the residential component for mixed-use developments.

*Bonus GFA for Indoor Recreational Space*

If the proposed communal indoor recreation spaces are less than 0.6% of
the total GFA of the development or 10sqm (whichever is higher), these
spaces shall be counted under the main building GFA instead of bonus
GFA.

Examples of communal indoor recreation spaces that may qualify for this
scheme include gyms, function rooms, libraries, game rooms and reading
rooms. Developers may propose other forms of communal indoor recreation
spaces for URA’s evaluation. These spaces shall be retained as common
property and kept accessible to residents of the development. They shall
only be used for non-commercial purposes.

The indoor recreation space bonus GFA scheme shall apply to all
development applications for new erection, amendments to approved
developments or additions and alterations (A&A) of existing private
non-landed residential developments or mixed-use developments with a
residential component.

All additional GFA granted under the indoor recreation space bonus GFA
scheme shall not form the future development potential of the site.
