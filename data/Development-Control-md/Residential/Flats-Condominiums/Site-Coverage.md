### Site Coverage

Site coverage ensures that there are adequate areas set aside for
greenery and landscaping within the development.

The computation of site coverage has been simplified to include all
building structures that protrude more than 1m from the ground as seen
from the top-down ‘Site Plan’ view, and is expressed as a percentage of
the net site area. The net site area refers to the area of the site
excluding areas to be vested to the State for public roads, public road
widening reserves<sup>1</sup>, and drainage reserves<sup>2</sup>.

The maximum site coverage for flats and condominiums is 50%.

In the Development Application, the Site Plan shall include a separate
site coverage layer for computation purposes. An example is shown below.

*Example of a Site Coverage Plan for Flats or Condominum Developments*

<sup>1</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

<sup>2</sup> **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes
of building or widening a public drain.
