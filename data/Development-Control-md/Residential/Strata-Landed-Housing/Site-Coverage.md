Communal Open Spaces

To safeguard the living environment of strata landed developments,
minimum 45% of the nett site area<sup>1</sup> of the strata landed
housing development shall be set aside for Communal Open Space (COS).

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> The nett site area shall
exclude land to be set aside for road widening & drainage
reserve.</span>

COS are communal recreational spaces provided for residents’ enjoyment.
Examples of COS are in the table below:

Of the 45% COS, at least 25% (as a percentage of site area) shall be set
aside for communal on-ground greenery.

Areas classified as COS shall not be included in the boundary of the
individual strata plots. For instance, the 2m planting strips and green
buffers which form part of the minimum 45% COS provision, shall not
contain any Private Enclosed Spaces (PES).
