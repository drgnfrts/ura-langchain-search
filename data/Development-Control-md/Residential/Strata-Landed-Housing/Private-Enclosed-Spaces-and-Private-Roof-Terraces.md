Private Enclosed Spaces

A Private Enclosed
Space <span style="color: #333333; line-height: 115%;">refers to a
semi-outdoor area adjacent to a strata unit and it forms part of the
private strata area of units which are sold to
homeowners. <span style="color: #333333; line-height: 115%;">All PES in
new strata landed submitted on or after 1 June 2023 will be computed as
GFA. PES in strata landed submitted before 1 June 2023 will not be
computed towards the development’s GFA.</span></span>

Private Roof Terraces (PRT)

**Private Roof Terrace**

<span style="line-height: 115%; color: #333333;">A Private Roof Terrace
refers to a semi-outdoor area located at the roof level of a strata unit
and it forms part of the private strata area of units which are sold to
homeowners. All PRT in new strata landed submitted on or after 1 June
2023 will be computed as GFA. PRT in a strata landed submitted before 1
June 2023 will not be computed towards the development's GFA. These
should be clearly annotated as "Private Roof Terraces'.</span>

3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to ensure
future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building
envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the
permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that
are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.</span></li>

profile of each individual strata landed units (see <a

upfront as part of the development application process. Developers may

choose from</span>.</li>

optional. Homeowners may choose from one of the approved designs, should
they wish to cover the PRT subsequently. Homeowners shall obtain MCST
clearance prior to installation. MCSTs may use the pre-approved designs
to guide homeowners who wish to install covers.</span></li>
