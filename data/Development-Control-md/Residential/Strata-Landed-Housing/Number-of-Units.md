Maximum number of strata landed units

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SL02_Intensity.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

*Dwelling Unit Cap and Maximum GFA*

The cap on the number of allowable units in strata landed housing
developments shall be based on the typical footprint of the conventional
landed housing form used and the development's location.

The formulae to compute the maximum number of allowable units in the
various types of strata landed housing developments are shown in the
table below.

The number of units shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Where necessary, URA may impose stricter controls on the allowable
number of strata landed units for developments in localised areas of
concern (eg severe infrastructural capacity issues), in consultation
with other agencies.

Gross Floor Area (Individual Units)

The gross floor area for each individual strata landed housing unit is
the resultant of the building form and envelope.

Gross Floor Area (Overall Development)

For developments comprising strata landed housing only, the overall
gross floor area is the resultant of the number of strata landed units
allowed. Refer to section above.

For residential developments with a mix of strata landed housing and
flat units, the overall Gross Floor Area shall be controlled by the
Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio for the site.
