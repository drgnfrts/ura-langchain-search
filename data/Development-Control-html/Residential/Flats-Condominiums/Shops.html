<h3>Ancillary Shops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A limited number of units for shops to provide personal services may be allowed in flats and condominium developments subject to evaluation taking into account the following considerations:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    the scale of the development as reflected in the total gross floor area;
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    the location of the site in relation to the main road;
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    the character of the surrounding developments; and
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    the planning intention of the surrounding area.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Up to 0.3% of the proposed residential gross floor area (excluding bonus balcony GFA, if any) may be proposed for shops. For example, flats and condominium developments with a proposed residential GFA of 20,000sqm may have up to 60sqm of shop GFA subject to the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    The total permissible GPR and GFA shall include the above-mentioned shop GFA.
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
    Only personal service trades may be allowed (eg mini-marts/laundromats). Independent offices are not allowed.
    </li>
</ul>
