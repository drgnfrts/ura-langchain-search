<h3>Open Space Provision</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The National Parks Board (NParks) requires new landed housing  development clusters of a certain total Gross Floor Area (GFA) to set aside an open space plot at a rate of 4<strong>.</strong>05sqm of open space for every 56sqm of gross floor area<sup>1</sup>. While the minimum open space plot size required is 1,000sqm (ie a landed housing development with total gross floor area of about 13,800sqm would be required to make such provision), NParks may require a smaller open space plot based on the same computation rate depending on the adequacy of open space in the nearby area.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The open space plot shall be vested in the State before the Building &amp; Construction Authority (BCA) issues a Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC). The open space shall be free from encumbrances, unless otherwise specified, before it can be vested in the State.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The open space provided shall be:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Suitably located within the proposed development, such that it is conveniently accessible to the public;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A single plot of a regular shape, and not fragmented (eg by road, drain or other reserves);
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Generally flat terrain that is neither low lying nor subject to flooding.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Where the landed housing development cluster abuts an expressway or major arterial road, part of the open space provision may double up as part of the buffer zone provided the:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Depth of the open space plot is 3m (minimum); and
    </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Configuration or the open space plot is reasonably regular.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> The Open Space Provision requirements are not applicable for Strata Landed Housing developments. See Strata Landed Housing Communal Open Space and greenery provision requirements.
