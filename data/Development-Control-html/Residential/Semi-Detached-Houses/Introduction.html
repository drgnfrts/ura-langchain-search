<p style="text-align: justify;">
A semi-detached house is one half of a pair of two houses, each with its own land title, separated by a common party wallÂ along one side of the premises. The pair of semi-detached houses is attached either side-to-side or back-to-back as illustrated above.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If an adjoining semi-detached house is demolished or redeveloped into a different housing form (eg to a bungalow), the left-behind (or existing) semi-detached house shall remain a semi-detached house as originally approved.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Semi-detached houses may be built in either areas designated for semi-detached housing or mixed landed housing, if the development site area can meet the requisite minimum plot size and plot width.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A semi-detached house shall adhere to the applicable storey height, envelope control guidelines and building setback requirements under the envelope control guidelines. The permissible Gross Floor Area (GFA) for landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and envelope.
