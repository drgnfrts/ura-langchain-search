CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Qualified Persons, developers, real estate agents and property owners

  

Effective Date:  
5 February 2018

  

1.  URA is introducing a new Pre-Application Consultation Service (PACS) that will complement the existing development application process. This is in response to industry feedback for URA to provide a formal platform where URA's guidance on development proposals can be sought upfront, before submission of a formal development application.

2.  PACS will be an optional service, which will allow applicants to pre-consult URA on the application of development guidelines on development proposals for specific sites before detailed plans are finalised. The service can help reduce time-consuming iterations and costly abortive work at the formal development application stage.

**Issues that can be pre-consulted on**

3.  URA can be consulted on the application of conservation, urban design and other development control guidelines on development proposals for a specific site (See [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2018/Feb/dc18-01/dc18-01-App1.pdf) for details). Proposals involving departures from the Master Plan planning parameters (i.e. land use, gross plot ratio, building and storey height) will not fall within the scope of PACS. Such proposals should be submitted as an Outline Application for planning assessment.

4.  Applicants who already have submitted their proposals to URA need not apply for this service. For such cases, applicants can contact the officers-in-charge of the proposals for clarifications or to apply for a formal written waiver directly.

**PACS submission process**

5.  Applications for PACS can be made via URA's website at this [link](https://www.ura.gov.sg/pacsWeb). The service will be charged according to the size and complexity of the proposed development (See PACS fee schedule in [Appendix 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2018/Feb/dc18-01/dc18-01-App2.pdf)).

6.  Upon receiving an application, URA will set up a meeting with the applicant and a Director-level representative from URA, to discuss the various issues raised. Following the meeting, URA will provide a formal Advice to the applicant. The Advice can be used as a guide to refine the proposal prior to submitting the formal development application (See [Appendix 3](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/User-Defined/URA-Online/circulars/2018/Feb/dc18-01/dc18-01-App3.pdf) for more details on the submission procedures).

**Implementation**

7.  PACS will be implemented with immediate effect as a pilot trial for one year. URA will review the effectiveness of the service at the end of the pilot period.  
      
    **\[Note: Due to the positive feedback from the industry, PACS will continue to be offered as a formal service beyond the initial trial period.\]**
