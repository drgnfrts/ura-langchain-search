1.  This circular is to inform the industry and business owners at Singapore River (Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay) of the updated guidelines for Outdoor Refreshment Areas (see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Apr/dc23-05_Annex-A\(1\).pdf)).  
      
    
2.  URA makes periodic review of our guidelines to ensure their relevance. The latest review was carried out following the completion of the Singapore River segment of the Round-Island-Route (RIR) and other improvements along the river promenade as part of adjacent redevelopments.  
      
    
3.   The guidelines for the ORAs at Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay were reviewed with a view to ensure public safety and enhance the community's experience along Singapore River.

**Details of Guidelines**

4.  The key updates to the guidelines are summarised as follows:
    
    a. Changes to the allowable extents for ORAs on State Land to account for RIR boundaries and improvements to the promenade as part of adjacent redevelopments (see [Appendix A-1 – A-4](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Apr/dc23-05_Appendices-A1-A4.pdf)); and  
      
    b. Mandating vertical boundary markers for ORAs along the RIR; (see [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Apr/dc23-05_Annex-A\(1\).pdf) and [Appendix A-5 – A-7](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Apr/dc23-05_Appendices-A5-A7.pdf))
