CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Building owners, developers, architects, engineers and traffic consultants.

  

Effective Date:  
1 February 2019

  

1.  The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have expanded the Walking and Cycling Plan (WCP) to include more developments that are required to submit a WCP.

2.  The WCP was first launched on 3 May 2016 to identify opportunities in the early design of developments to better cater to the needs of active mobility users, including pedestrians and cyclists. As part of the Walk Cycle Ride SG vision, the WCP consultation process has fostered a more conducive and safer environment for active mobility in and around developments. WCP will therefore be expanded to include more developments to enhance our active mobility environment.

3.  In addition to the Commercial, Retail, Business Park and Education Institute development categories, selected private Residential, Medical, Hotel and Recreational developments listed in [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Dec/dc18-12/dc18-12annexA.pdf) will be required to submit a WCP as part of Development Applications to LTA and URA.

4.  While the WCP submission process will continue to leverage on the existing Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) process, developments that are not listed in [Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Dec/dc18-12/dc18-12annexA.pdf) may also be required to submit a WCP as part of their Development Application if they meet the following criteria:
    1.  Developments located in car-lite precinctsa; or
    2.  Developments located within 400m of major transport nodes, i.e. within Zone 2b; or
    3.  Retail, Office, Mixed Use developments.Developers whose projects meet these criteria are strongly encouraged to check with the LTA for the requirement of a WCP prior to the Development Consultation stage.

5.  The appointed traffic consultant and Qualified Person of the project should submit a preliminary WCP before the TIA scoping meeting, where LTA and URA will jointly evaluate the proposal to ensure all walking and cycling related designs have been considered in the development proposalc. Please refer to [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Dec/dc18-12/dc18-12annexB.pdf) for the WCP submission flowchart.

**Implementation**

6.  The expanded WCP requirement will take effect on 1 February 2019. Developers submitting new applications that meet the LTA TIA/WCP requirements to URA (i.e. applications for a new erection or reconstruction) on or after this date will be required to submit a WCP.

7.  Please refer to [https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html) to download the guidelines on WCP. The guidelines will also be incorporated into the Code of Practice "Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works" in its forthcoming update. Please submit the WCP as part of the TIA pre-scoping consultation with LTA (via [lta-dbc\_registry@lta.gov.sg](https://www.ura.gov.sgmailto:lta-dbc_registry@lta.gov.sg)) before submitting a development application to URA. Please refer to [Annex B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Dec/dc18-12/dc18-12annexB.pdf) for submission flowchart.

8.  To aid the industry in developing active mobility-related infrastructure in a holistic manner, agencies have produced a Walking & Cycling Design Guide as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be downloaded at [https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltaweb/corp/GreenTransport/2018/walking-and-cycling-design-guide.pdf](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Active-Mobility/WalkingCyclingDesignGuideSG.pdf).
