CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

Who Should Know:  
Architects, engineers, developers, owners and tenants

Effective Date:  
With effect from 13 August 2018

1.  International visitor numbers have been rising in recent years and are expected to grow further with corresponding increases in future demand for hotel rooms and hostel bed spaces. To cater for this demand, from 13 August 2018, URA will consider new hotel and backpackers' hostel proposals on sites that are not zoned or permitted for Hotel use and evaluate them individually, taking into account the planning intention, and compatibility with the surrounding land uses. In some areas where an increase in numbers for such developments would displace other commercial uses or affect the residential amenity of these areas, new proposals for such uses will generally not be supported. Please refer to [Appendix A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/Jun/dc18-04/dc18-04-AppA.pdf) for the list of areas.

2.  This revision will supersede URA's circulars released on 7 July 2014 ([URA/PB/2014/18-PPG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2014/jul/dc14-18)) and 12 August 2016 ([URA/PB/2016/13-PCUDG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2016/Aug/dc16-13)). The revised guidelines will take effect from 13 August 2018 and will apply to all new development applications received on or after the effective date. The guidelines will not apply to formal Development Applications (excluding Outline Applications) with a valid Provisional Permission issued prior to the effective date.
