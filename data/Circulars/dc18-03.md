CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Building owners, developers, architects, engineers and traffic consultants

  

Effective Date:  
8 May 2018

  

1.  The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) aim to promote cycling as a mode of transport, so as to enhance liveability and support the car-lite vision for Singapore. Initiatives such as expanding the cycling path network in residential towns and providing more bicycle parking spaces at key transport nodes have been well-received. To augment these efforts, the government will be setting new bicycle parking provision standards for developments, and new Gross Floor Area (GFA) exemption criteria for Active Mobility related facilities.

**New Bicycle Parking Standards**

2.  It is important for developments to provide sufficient and well-maintained bicycle parking spaces in order to facilitate more people to take up cycling as a commuting mode and to minimise indiscriminate parking in public places.

3.  LTA is introducing a new bicycle parking provision standard for all new developments and buildings undergoing redevelopment or reconstruction1. (See [Table 1 of Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/May/dc18-03/dc18-03-Annex-A.pdf?la=en)). For developments located in Zone 1 & Zone 22, LTA may exercise flexibility to grant a reduction in the bicycle parking provision requirement, taking into consideration the development's location and type. This **mandatory requirement** will take effect from **8 May 2018** for any new application for new development, redevelopment and reconstruction works to URA.

4.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA (via Corenet) before submitting a development application (e.g. new erection, redevelopment, and reconstruction application) to URA for Planning Permission.

5.  Developers are also encouraged to cater to both short-term and long-term bicycle parking needs as listed in [Table 2 of Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/May/dc18-03/dc18-03-Annex-A.pdf?la=en#page=4). All other existing developments are also strongly encouraged to proactively provide bicycle parking spaces according to the new standards. Existing developments providing or removing bicycle parking spaces shall submit a parking proposal to LTA (via Corenet) for approval.

**Incentives for Bicycle Parking-Related Facilities**

**Gross Floor Area (GFA) Exemption**

6.  Bicycle parking spaces provided according to LTA's new bicycle parking provision standards will be exempted from Gross Floor Area (GFA) computation. The GFA exemption will also apply to surplus provision of bicycle parking spaces over and above LTA's minimum requirements if assessed by LTA and URA to be reasonable, given the context of the development. Bicycle parking spaces should be located at convenient locations for cyclists, taking into consideration the alignment of adjacent cycling paths/shared paths, public transportation nodes and amenities.

7.  In addition, provision of the End-of-Trip facilities listed in [Table 3 of Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2018/May/dc18-03/dc18-03-Annex-A.pdf?la=en#page=6) can also qualify for GFA exemption. This is to encourage developers to provide End-of-Trip facilities to better meet the needs of cyclists. Developers can submit their proposals for URA's evaluation. In general, URA will consider whether the size of the facility is appropriate, taking reference from LTA's guidelines on these facilities3. The End-of-Trip facilities should also be located near the bicycle parking spaces for the convenience of cyclists.

**Travel Smart Grant (Developer)**

8.  LTA has extended the Travel Smart Grant to developers to co-fund the cost of providing those End-of-Trip facilities on 29 September 2017. LTA will co-fund up to 80% of the construction costs of End-of-Trip facilities for each successful Travel Smart Grant (Developer) application, up to a maximum of $80,000 per development. A total sum of $3 million has been allocated as a Travel Smart Grant (Developer) for developers and building owners. This grant will be available until 31 May 2019. More information on the Travel Smart Grant for provision of End-of-Trip facilities can be found at: [https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/TSG-for-developers.html](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/TSG-for-developers.html).

**Good Practice Guide on Bicycle Parking and Related Facilities**

9.  A set of good practice guides have been established in the Code of Practice on Street Work Proposals Relating to Development Works4, to guide developers, architects and building owners on the plan and design of these facilities.
