**Background**

1.  The Community/Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS) facilitates the co-location of compatible community and sports uses with highly accessible commercial developments for mutual benefit. Under the CSFS, bonus Gross Floor Area (GFA) for community and/or sports uses (hereinafter referred to as the "CSFS space") is allowed over and above the maximum permissible GFA under the Master Plan for highly accessible commercial developments2 . Since its introduction in 2003, the CSFS has benefited a wide range of community/sports users, including public libraries and non-profit community service providers1 like eldercare, child care and other social services.  
      
    
2.  To qualify for the CSFS, the community/sports uses should be non-profit in nature and endorsed by the relevant championing government agency. The activities carried out within the CSFS space should have a predominant public outreach component that directly serves the public.  
      
    
3.  To support ECDA's efforts to expand the provision of good quality and affordable child care services, the guidelines of the CSFS also extend to commercial child care centres that meet the ECDA's quality and affordability criteria (see details in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf)).
  
**CSFS guidelines**

6.  The details of the CSFS guidelines are summarised in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf)[.](https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/-/media/User%20Defined/URA%20Online/circulars/2014/Feb/dc14-01app1.pdf?la=en) The CSFS guidelines will apply to all new applications for community/sport use submitted on or after the effective date.  
      
    
7.  [Appendix 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf#page=8) gives an overview of the parties responsible for ensuring that the community/sports space continues to be used for the approved purpose. [Appendices 3A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf#page=9), [3B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf#page=12) and [3C](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf#page=14) are Letters of Undertaking to be submitted by various community and sports users to URA. [Appendix 4](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Feb/dc20-01---App1-4.pdf#page=17) charts out the procedure required to obtain approval for the CSFS.

If payable, development charge (DC) or differential premium (DP) will be levied for the bonus GFA, based on the approved community or sports use.
