CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Qualified Persons, developers, real estate agents and property owners

  

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

  

1.  URA has simplified how site coverage is computed. This will make it easier for QPs to compute the site coverage of their proposed development, reducing the time taken to prepare submission drawings to URA for planning permission.

**Simplification of Site Coverage Guidelines**

2.  QPs currently compute the site coverage of their developments by including the areas of the site covered by the building block. In addition, QPs have to factor in other building structures such as ledges, eaves, balconies and linkways depending on the extent of their projection from the main building and positions of vertical supports, etc. URA recognises that there is scope to streamline the approach in defining site coverage to enhance clarity and objectivity.

3.  Hence, URA has revised the definition of site coverage to simply include all building structures that protrude more than 1m from the ground, as seen from the top-down "Site Plan" view (see Figure A).

**Figure A**: An example of the revised site coverage computation method

4.  To accommodate this new definition, URA has correspondingly increased the allowable site coverage for the various developments as shown in Figure B.

**Implementation**

5.  The revised site coverage guidelines will apply with immediate effect. Development applications submitted before the effective date of 5 July 2019 which have already obtained Provisional Permission, or which will result in a Provisional Permission, will not be subject to the revised guidelines. These applicants may, however, choose to adopt the simplified site coverage computation based on the revised guidelines upon resubmission.

6.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.
