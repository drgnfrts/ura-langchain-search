1.  This is an update to the [circular](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2016/May/dc16-10) dated 30 May 2016 – "New Locations Where Additional Eating Houses in Shophouses Will Not Be Allowed".
  
3.  URA and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) periodically review the list of areas where no new eating houses1 can be approved to prevent the existing traffic and parking problems from worsening. These areas were identified after taking into consideration concerns raised by the surrounding residents over traffic and indiscriminate parking issues due to the existing eating houses in these areas.
  
5.  This latest review has taken into account the prevailing ground situation, redevelopments and evolving business climate and operating landscape brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
  
7.  The full list of locations where new eating houses will not be allowed are in [Appendix A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Oct/dc23-08-AppendixA.pdf). This supersedes the previous list in URA's circular dated 30 May 2016.
  
9.  We will renew the Temporary Permission of existing eating houses that are within the locations in [Appendix A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Oct/dc23-08-AppendixA.pdf) if there are no major complaints on disamenity arising from the use, and there is no breach of our planning guidelines and conditions.
  
11.  For sites located outside the areas in [Appendix A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Oct/dc23-08-AppendixA.pdf), all proposals for new eating houses will be subject to contextual evaluation, taking into consideration the planning intention for the site, compatibility with/potential disamenity impact of the use on the surrounding developments, and input from LTA and relevant agency. Planning approval is not guaranteed.
  
13.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. If you or your members have any queries concerning this circular, please [write](https://www.ura.gov.sg/feedbackWeb/contactus_feedback.jsp) to us. For other information on the type of allowable uses in shophouses, you may refer to [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/).
