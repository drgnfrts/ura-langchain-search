1 To provide further clarity in the eligible claims and payments by purchasers, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Part 8C Relief) Regulations have been amended. The key changes are related to the cost of securing alternative accommodation and assessor's fee:

a Purchasers of residential properties can claim from the developer the qualifying costs[\[1\]](file:///C:/Users/urakuahkt/Desktop/Circular_amendments%20to%20COTMA%20Part%208C%20Relief.docx#_ftn1) incurred to secure alternative accommodation in a hotel, hostel, serviced apartment, boarding house, lodging house or dormitory during the period of delay. This will give purchasers more options, e.g. those who are faced with a relatively short delay, and therefore cannot secure a lease because of the minimum stay duration, will be able to be reimbursed for alternative accommodation; and

b Purchasers will co-pay a fee for applications for a subsequent determination by an assessor on the amount of qualifying costs payable to a purchaser. The fee payable to the assessor is computed based on the total time that the assessor takes to determine the application, at a rate of $100 per hour or part of an hour and subject to a maximum fee of $2,400.

2 The amendments have been gazetted and are effective with immediate effect. For more details on the relief measures and the processes under Part 8C of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, please refer to [https://go.gov.sg/ura-covid-19-relief-measure](https://go.gov.sg/ura-covid-19-relief-measure).

[\[1\]](file:///C:/Users/urakuahkt/Desktop/Circular_amendments%20to%20COTMA%20Part%208C%20Relief.docx#_ftnref1) Includes the rent paid for the alternative accommodation, estate agent fees, moving costs, stamp duty or legal fees and penalties incurred for early termination (capped at 1 month of rent), but excludes any security deposit and costs of any goods and services provided in connection with the use of the alternative premises or alternative accommodation.
