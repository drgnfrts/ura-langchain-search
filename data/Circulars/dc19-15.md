1.  In collaboration with the local chapter of the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS SG), URA has released Volumes 4 and 5 of a series of Conservation Technical Handbooks.

2.  This is an eight-volume series covering different aspects of technical restoration, architectural elements and material usage for heritage buildings. The series will contain best practices and technical expertise on restoration works, and detailed information on locally used materials, construction methods and restoration techniques.

3.  The series aims to promote better quality restoration projects and overall maintenance, enhance the level of competency within the heritage building industry, and increase appreciation for our built heritage. Through quality technical restoration and maintenance, our heritage buildings can be better sustained into the future. "Volume 1: Introduction" was released on 15 Dec 2017. "Volume 2: Roofs" and "Volume 3: Facades" were released on 12 Nov 2018.

4.  The latest two volumes outline common problems, best practices, and technical expertise for the restoration and long-term maintenance of:

    Volume 4: Structure  
    Different types of key historic structures.

    Volume 5: Doors and Windows  
    Different types of historic doors and windows, including gates, vents, grilles and ironmongery.

5.  The five volumes are now available [online](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Best-Practices) for download.

6.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. The conservation guidelines for conserved shophouses and bungalows are also available [online](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Conservation-Guidelines).
