1.  As part of the Draft Master Plan 2019, URA has reviewed the prevailing urban design guidelines for developments within Downtown Core Planning Area, particularly for the Anson and Cecil subzones. See [Annex A-1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-05/dc19-05-A1.pdf) and [A-2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-05/dc19-05-A2.pdf) for details.

2.  The revisions are to reflect the larger positioning of the Central Business District (CBD) as a vibrant mixed use precinct, not only for work, but also to live and play in. Areas like Anson and Cecil, leveraging their proximity to existing residential areas and amenities, are envisioned as mixed use urban neighbourhoods, characterised by a live-in community, more intimately scaled streetblocks, active streets and vibrant public spaces.

3.  In keeping with the repositioning of these areas, the urban design guidelines have been revised. We have also taken the opportunity to update the guidelines applicable to the rest of Downtown Core Planning Area.

4.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of these circulars to your members. You are advised to refer to the Development Control Handbooks and URA's website for updated guidelines instead of referring to past circulars.
