1.  URA is pleased to announce that the 2019 Architectural Heritage Awards (AHA) is now open for submissions. This annual Awards recognises owners, professionals and contractors who have gone beyond the basic essentials to restore gazetted National Monuments and conserved buildings or add new buildings that are well-integrated into their historic context. They serve to set a high standard for others to follow.

2.  There are three categories for the Awards:  
      
    *   Award for Restoration  
        This is for projects that demonstrate exemplary restoration of gazetted heritage buildings. The assessment will take into account how far the project adhered to the three ‘R' principles of maximum retention, sensitive restoration and careful repair, as well as the "top-down" approach.
    *   Award for Restoration & Innovation  
        This is for integrated "old" and "new" developments that demonstrate exemplary restoration of gazetted heritage buildings as well as innovation and architectural excellence of the new developments, and how the "new" draw inspiration from and enhance the "old".
    *   Award for New Design in Heritage Contexts  
        This is for outstanding new architecture and design projects within a gazetted conservation site or area that is well integrated with its historic context; and which serves to enrich, and enhance the appreciation of its heritage setting.

3.  At the discretion of the Assessment Committee, a project may be conferred ‘Special Mention' for commendable efforts in some aspects of the restoration work.

4.  Application is open to all projects that have obtained Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) or Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC).

5.  Each application is to be submitted by the building owner and endorsed by the Qualified Person (Architect), the Qualified Person (Engineer), the main Contractor, and the Conservation Specialist if one has been engaged for the project.

6.  Eligible submissions will be judged by an Assessment Committee chaired by URA's Chairman and comprising representatives from URA, other government agencies, industry professionals and academia.

7.  Please note projects that are largely contemporary interior design works or have unapproved use, illegal works, unresolved planning issues will be disqualified. These criteria will be used to pre-screen applications received at URA's discretion and will not be assessed by the Assessment Committee.

8.  Further details of the Awards, eligibility, assessment criteria, application form and submission requirements can be accessed from the URA website at [http://ura.sg/AHAsg](http://ura.sg/AHAsg).

9.  Submissions will close on Monday, 3 June 2019 at 5 p.m.
