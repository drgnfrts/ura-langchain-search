CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Building owners, agricultural industry stakeholders, developers, and architects

  

Effective Date:  
With effect from 20 September 2019

  

1.  The agriculture landscape in Singapore is evolving. High-intensity and high-rise agriculture developments allow us to achieve greater productivity and optimise the use of land, while also enhancing our food resilience.
  
3.  To facilitate the transformation of the agriculture industry, support more intensive agriculture developments, and ensure that agriculture developments are compatible with their surroundings, URA has introduced planning guidelines specific to agriculture developments. URA has also streamlined the planning application process to enable applicants to obtain faster approval at a lower cost.  
      
    **Planning Guidelines**
    
4.  The new planning guidelines specific to agriculture developments are found in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/Appendix-1.pdf). Apart from the listed planning guidelines, the applicant is to comply with the requirements of technical agencies such as LTA, NParks, FSSD, PUB, BCA, NEA, DSTA etc.  
      
    **Streamlined Planning Application Process**
    
5.  URA has streamlined the planning application process as follows:

1.  Land Leased or Sold by the State for Agriculture Use

5.  Development proposals involving single storey structures not exceeding 12m in height shall be authorised, ie there is no need to submit an application to URA for planning approval. This is provided there is no retail / F&B (i.e. shop, restaurant, showroom use) or visitor centre use; and the structures comply with the minimum building setback / road buffer set out in the planning guidelines for agriculture developments in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/Appendix-1.pdf). The proposed works may start after written consent is obtained from the lessor.
  
7.  For development proposals involving structures that exceed 1-storey or 12m in height, and fully comply with planning guidelines for agriculture development and lodgement criteria (listed in [Appendix 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/A2.pdf)), applicants may engage a Qualified Person (QP) to lodge their plans with URA for instant approval.
  
9.  Proposals that do not satisfy the authorisation or lodgment criteria will have to submit a development application to URA (see [Appendix 3](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/A3.pdf)). 

2.  Land Tenanted Out or Granted Temporary Occupation Licence by the State for Agriculture Use

8.  Works on land tenanted out or granted Temporary Occupation Licence (TOL) by the State for agriculture use on an interim basis1 shall be authorised without the need to submit an application to URA for planning approval, provided the proposed works are in accordance with the parameters stipulated in the tenancy agreement and the conditions in [Appendix 3](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/A3.pdf).
  
10.  However, a Development Application shall be submitted to URA for planning consideration, if the proposed works deviate from the planning parameters stipulated in the tenancy agreement.  
      
    **Implementation**
    
11.  All proposed agriculture works will require endorsement from the lessor (e.g. SLA, SFA or NParks), regardless of whether the works are authorised, lodged or submitted to URA for planning approval. The information that has to be endorsed by the lessor is summarised in [Appendix 4](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Sep/dc19-17/Appendix-4.pdf).
  
13.  The new guidelines and streamlined plan application process shall apply to all new proposals for works on agriculture land with immediate effect.2
