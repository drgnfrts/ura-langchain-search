1.  URA has reviewed and updated the Street Block Plan for [Cantonment Road](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Mar/dc20-02---Annex-A#page=5.ashx) Conservation Area in view of the realignment of the rear service road in Master Plan 2019.  
      
    
2.  The updated street block plan includes planning parameters such as the type of land use, building height, form of development, and covered walkway requirements and vehicular access. Conserved buildings are required to comply with the detailed conservation guidelines for the area. The prescribed guidelines are tabulated and attached in [](/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Mar/dc20-02---Annex-A.pdf)[Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Mar/dc20-02---Annex-A.pdf) (updated 26 March 2020).
