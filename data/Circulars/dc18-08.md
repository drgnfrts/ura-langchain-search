Who Should Know:  
Developers, architects, engineers and homeowners

  

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

  

1.  URA is introducing a new Bonus GFA scheme to encourage the greater provision of indoor recreation spaces in private non-landed residential developments.

2.  The new scheme provides bonus GFA capped at 1% of total GFA (or the GFA of the residential component for mixed-use developments). It seeks to promote more activities and bonding among residents through the provision of covered communal spaces.

**Indoor Recreation Space Bonus GFA Scheme**

3.  Currently, there are no specific requirements for the provision of indoor recreation spaces in non-landed residential developments and the provision is left to the market. Such spaces are weather-proof and offer opportunities for greater communal interaction among residents. While some developments do provide indoor recreation spaces today, there is scope to encourage more of such spaces to promote community bonding.

4.  Private non-landed residential developments and the residential component of mixed-use developments can apply for the communal indoor recreation spaces to be counted as bonus GFA, provided such spaces exceed 0.6% of the total GFA of the development or 10 sqm (whichever is higher)1. The bonus GFA is capped at 1% of total GFA (or the GFA of the residential component for mixed-use developments). See **Figure 1** below.

5.  Examples of communal indoor recreation spaces that can qualify for this scheme include gyms, function rooms, libraries, game rooms and reading rooms. Developers may propose other appropriate communal indoor recreation spaces for URA's evaluation. These spaces are to be retained as common property of the development and kept accessible to residents of the development. They are only to be used for non-commercial purposes.

**Implementation**

6.  The indoor recreation space bonus GFA scheme will apply with immediate effect to all development applications for new erection, amendments to approved developments or additions and alterations (A&A) of existing private non-landed residential developments or mixed-use developments with a residential component.

7.  The scheme, together with all existing and future schemes, will form a menu of bonus GFA schemes and provide more choices for the industry. The overall cap of 10% for additional GFA allowed beyond the Master Plan allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) for each development site continues to apply2. As per current practice, all additional GFA granted under the bonus GFA incentive schemes will not form the future development potential of the site.
