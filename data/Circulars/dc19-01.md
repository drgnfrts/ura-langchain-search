Who Should Know:  
Developers, building owners, property managers, architects and engineers.

  
  

1.  The Loading Bay Management (LBM) system comprises software that allows building owners to better manage their loading bays through dock scheduling and queue management. Building owners can request for logistics service providers to first book time slots on the scheduling system before making deliveries at the pre-determined times.

2.  The LBM system presents multiple benefits for building owners and tenants:  
      
    1.  Building Owners  
          
        With deliveries made during pre-determined slots, queuing by delivery vehicles to enter the loading bays will be reduced. This can help to reduce potential traffic spill overs and hence, reduce conflict between delivery vehicles and other traffic.  
          
        In addition, as the vehicles can be given security clearance in advance through the booking system, turn-around time of the delivery vehicles can be further lowered, hence optimising the use of the loading bays,  
          
        Last but not least, the LBM system can reduce the manpower needed to manage loading bays by leveraging on technology (e.g. video analytics, IU-enabled loading bay gantries) to manage the delivery traffic.
    2.  Tenants  
          
        Building tenants will have greater control over delivery times. For tenants who need to fulfil just-in-time deliveries, they can have the option to pre-book the loading bay lots for their logistics service providers at selected timeslots.

3.  Enterprise Singapore (ESG), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) encourage the adoption of the LBM system as this would optimise the use of loading bays and improve local traffic circulation.

4.  As part of ESG's mandate to help retail buildings grow through capability upgrading and business transformation, it provides support to early adopters of the LBM system through its grant support scheme, subject to its approval. Please refer to [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jan/dc19-01/dc1901app12.pdf) for a list of possible loading bay management logistics services providers who can operate the LBM system.
