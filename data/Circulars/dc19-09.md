CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES  
  
Please note that the validity of this circular has been extended until 5 July 2025.

  

Who Should Know:  
Architects, developers, engineers

  

Effective Date:  
With effect from 5th July 2019 and to remain valid until 5th July 2025

  

1.  Landscape decks are raised carpark decks that are partially concealed with greenery and earth berm to mitigate its visual impact on the streetscape. The landscape deck guidelines were introduced in 2004 for residential non-landed developments to provide an alternative to basement carparks or multi-storey carparks. The guidelines have now been revised to allow the removal of the earth berm if vertical greenery are provided along the edge of the landscape deck to minimise its visual impact.

2.  The revision is in response to industry feedback that the earth berm requirement adds substantial construction cost and limits design options for the landscape deck. Under the revised guidelines, the space previously used for the earth berm can be freed up for other uses such as communal facilities, landscaping or circulation spaces ([Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-09/dc19-09-App1.pdf)).

**Details of the Revision**

3.  To sufficiently screen and to mitigate the visual impact of the landscape deck, at least 50% of the exposed wall of the deck at each facade must be screened with vertical greening1. Elevation plans showing the screened wall with respective coverage area in square metres should be provided2  ([Appendix 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-09/dc19-09-App2.pdf)).

4.  A detailed landscaping plan should also be submitted, including the proposed schedule and layout of the plant species ([Appendix 3](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-09/dc19-09-App3.pdf)). For vertical greenery systems, plans should show the details of the system via section cuts, accompanied by perspectives of the elevation.

5.  The landscaping and screening proposal will be subject to evaluation at the Development Application stage to ensure that the greenery proposed is sufficiently lush and layered (i.e. a mix of bushes, shrubs, and trees) to mitigate the visual impact. The overall treatment of the vertical wall with greening should be well designed.

6.  The other existing guidelines for the landscape deck will remain e.g. locational criteria, envelope, height cap. A summary of the revised guidelines can be found in [Appendix 4](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-09/dc19-09-App4.pdf).

7.  Developers and architects will still have the option to propose earth berms to mitigate the visual impact of the landscape deck. A combination of earth berms and vertical greenery can also be proposed, provided that at least 50% of the exposed wall of the deck at each façade are screened. The corresponding elevation plans and coverage area computation should be provided.

8.  Where there are site-specific urban design guidelines issued for a development, the site-specific guidelines will take precedence over the revised landscape deck guidelines.

**Implementation**

9.  The revised landscape deck guidelines will take immediate effect. This circular will supersede Circular No. URA/PB/2004/09-DCD and URA/PB/2009/11-DCG, and will remain valid until 5 July 2025.

10.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.

1 50% of exposed wall on every elevation plan will have to be screened with vertical greening. Lush planting around the raised deck in addition to the vertical greening is highly encouraged for screening purposes. Vertical greenery and lush planting may qualify as Landscape Replacement Area if they fulfil the requirements under the LUSH 3.0 guidelines introduced in November 2017 (Circular No. [URA/PB/2017/06-DCG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2017/Nov/dc17-06)).

2 Photos of as-built condition or site inspections will be required at later stages, e.g. before the point of obtaining TOP/CSC clearance, to ensure compliance with the revised guidelines.
