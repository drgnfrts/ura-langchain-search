1.  URA and PUB have carried out a post implementation review of the guidelines for new landed housing developments affected by PUB's Minimum Platform Level (MPL) requirements. The revised guidelines are aimed at mitigating level differences between the existing ground levels and building structures / internal living areas, while still meeting MPL requirements.

2.  In 2016, URA and PUB provided clarifications on the guidelines for new landed housing developments in low-lying areas to safeguard the overall character of landed housing estates. Based on these earlier guidelines, only the building structures/internal living areas needed to be raised to meet the stipulated MPL, for flood protection purposes under the Code of Practice (COP) on Surface Water Drainage. The existing ground levels within the rest of the development site, termed as ancillary areas in PUB's COP, were to be generally retained, to avoid excessive earth-fill or new retaining walls. This was to safeguard the overall character of the estate by minimising the impact on the streetscape and surrounding developments.

**More Flexibility for Earth-fill Within the Side and Rear Setback Areas**

3.  In response to feedback from the industry and homeowners, we have refined the guidelines further, and can now allow the side and rear setback areas of the development site to also be raised to meet PUB's stipulated MPL (refer to Figure 1). This will help mitigate level differences between these setback areas and the adjacent building structures / internal living areas, which must meet the MPL. Any common retaining cum boundary walls or fences should be designed sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of adjacent houses or land parcels.

4.  The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to the required MPL, so as to safeguard the streetscape of the estate. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower than the existing ground level, whichever is higher. Limited earth-fill necessary for access into the house and level mitigation (e.g. for steps/ramps at the front leading into the house) resulting in new outward-facing retaining walls will be assessed individually, based on the site context and impact on the surroundings.

**Assessment of Allowable Storey Height**

5.  The overall allowable height of the building under the [envelope control guidelines for landed houses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2015/Feb/dc15-02) will continue to be measured from the MPL imposed on the site.

**Plan Endorsement for Submissions for New Landed Houses**

6.  The Qualified Person (QP) is required to endorse the following condition on the drawings during the submission:  
      
    

**Implementation**

7.  This circular is to supersede the earlier Circular [URA/PB/2016/16-DCG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Data/circulars/Archive/2016/Oct/dc16-16) released on 3 Oct 2016, and the revised guidelines will apply with immediate effect to all new applications.

We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.
