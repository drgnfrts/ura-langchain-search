Effective Date:  
With effect from 18 Nov 2019

  

1.  To enhance protection of home buyers' interest by ensuring that developers deliver quality housing to home buyers, the requirement for Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) Scheme will be imposed via a new licence condition in the housing developer's licence issued to developers with:  
      
    1.  no CONQUAS track record for private residential development in the past 3 years, or
      
    2.  at least one private residential development in the past 3 years with CONQUAS score below the threshold CONQUAS score1, or
      
    3.  at least one private residential development in the past 3 years with significant number of major defects2.
2.  In assessing whether the developer will be subject to the CONQUAS requirement, the CONQUAS track record and quality of private residential development which involved the developer, any of its shareholders, and related corporation3 of the shareholders will be considered.
  
3.  CONQUAS was launched in 1989 to provide the industry with a standard assessment framework for benchmarking of workmanship quality. CONQUAS is an existing requirement for new building projects constructed on Government Land Sales (GLS) sites and public sector building projects with contract value above $5 million. It has helped to raise construction workmanship standards in the industry.
