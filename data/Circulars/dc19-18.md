4.  All new developments, redevelopments and existing buildings undergoing major or minor refurbishment are required to comply with the updated guidelines.
  
6.  The urban design guidelines provide an overview of the general requirements for developments in the respective Urban Design Areas. For specific sites, additional guidelines may be issued where necessary. The guidelines included herewith do not supersede the detailed guidelines issued, nor the approved plans for developments for specific sites.
