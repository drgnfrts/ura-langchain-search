CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Home owners, architects, developers and real estate agents

  

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

  

**Details**

1.  In consultation with the residents, URA has introduced a street block plan for the abovementioned houses within Greenridge Crescent estate, as shown in [Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-13/dc19-13-Ann1.pdf).

2.  This street block plan will be used to guide development (for redevelopment or addition & alteration proposals) within the affected street blocks.

**Guidelines**

3.  Greenridge Crescent estate was built in the 1980s in the Tudor style, with its characteristic front-gable pitched roofs. Some home owners expressed a desire to keep the front-gable pitched roof of their house, to maintain some consistency of design along their row of houses even when renovations and rebuilding works are carried out to meet the changing needs of residents. A poll was conducted amongst the residents, and all owners of the houses included in this street block plan have agreed to be included in this plan.

4.  These houses within the street block plan will be required to keep the existing profile of their front-gable pitched roof (which may be paired with the adjacent house) when they carry out addition & alteration works or redevelop. Other than keeping the front-gable pitched roof, owners will have flexibility in determining other design aspects, such as choice of façade and roof material, building façade colour, etc. They will also have the flexibility to carry out addition and alteration works or redevelop the rest of the house in accordance with URA's envelope control guidelines for landed housing (refer to detailed guidelines in Appendices [A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-13/dc19-13-AppA.pdf), [B](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-13/dc19-13-AppB.pdf) and [C](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Jul/dc19-13/dc19-13-AppC.pdf)).

5.  I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation. We have updated the same in the [Development Control Handbooks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control). You are advised to refer to these Handbooks for the most updated guidelines and procedures instead of referring to past circulars.
