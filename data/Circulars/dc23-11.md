Effective Date:  
With effect from 4 December 2023

  

1.  As part of its continuous efforts to cater to diverse housing needs, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has consulted the industry extensively and will pilot a new Serviced Apartments II (SA2) housing typology, also known as Long-stay Serviced Apartments. Similar to the existing Serviced Apartments (SA), SA2 is intended as a form of rental accommodation, but for longer-term stay beyond the current minimum of seven days for existing SA. Piloting SA2 will expand the range of housing options available in meeting the demand for rental housing from Singaporeans and those coming to work or study here.  
      
    
2.  SA2 will be subject to the following set of guidelines (see [Appendix](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Dec/dc23-11---Appendix.pdf) for details).  
      
    2.  Minimum Stay DurationSA2 units shall be rented out for lodging purposes for a minimum period of three months, similar to residential developments. This is to ensure that SA2 can better meet the needs of tenants who require a longer stay duration.
        
    3.  Locational CriteriaGiven the longer minimum stay duration of three months, SA2 occupants will be less transient in nature. SA2 can therefore be allowed in more locations compared to existing SA (see [Appendix](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2023/Dec/dc23-11---Appendix.pdf)).
        
    4.  Unit ConfigurationAs part of this pilot, we will also give SA2 developers / operators flexibility to experiment with new concepts. SA2 can comprise a mixture of unit sizes, as long as there is a minimum average unit size of 35sqm (nett). Flexibility is also given in terms of unit layouts – these need not be self-contained with the full suite of living / dining / kitchen amenities, but units should minimally be en-suite (i.e. with attached bathroom). Nonetheless, developers / operators should ensure that these units can still serve as quality and meaningful living spaces for tenants.
        
    5.  No Strata Subdivision  
        SA2 are expected to be owned en-bloc and operated by a single operator, similar to SA.
3.  Applicants who wish to propose SA2 can submit an Outline Application to URA to determine the suitability of their site. Depending on site context, URA may in some cases approve SA2 proposals only on Temporary Permission, to better allow agencies to monitor the pilot and impact to surrounding uses.  
      
    **Implementation**
    
4.  These guidelines will take effect from 4 December 2023 and will apply to all new applications submitted on or after that date.  
      
    
5.  To kickstart the implementation of the pilot, URA has launched for tender two Government Land Sales (GLS) sites at Upper Thomson Road and Zion Road with a minimum SA2 quantum requirement. Interested tenderers are advised to refer to the respective tender documents for the specific SA2 requirements for these two sites, which take into consideration the planning intention for the area.
