Who Should Know:  
Developers

  

Effective Date:  
From 3 June 2019

  

1.  As part of URA's efforts to harness technology to improve service delivery, we have launched two new eServices to facilitate licensed housing developers in:
    1.  Submitting their Audited Accounts (AA) and Auditor's Certification (AC); and
    2.  Applying for extension of time to submit their AA and AC.

2.  Under the Housing Developers (Control & Licencing) Act and Housing Developers (Project Account) Rules, licensed housing developers are required to submit their AA and AC on the project account to the Controller of Housing within six months after the close of every financial year. The Controller may, in his discretion, grant a one-time extension of up to six months for the submission.

3.  With effect from 3 June 2019, licensed housing developers are able to submit the AA and AC through the new eService. The new eServices can be accessed via these links:-  
      
    *   Submission of AA and AC –

**Electronic Payment of Housing Developer's Licence Fees**

4.  To further enhance the eService for developers applying for housing developer's licence, the licence fees can now be paid electronically, via internet banking or telegraphic transfer. This is in addition to the current mode of payment via cheque.
