1.  This joint advisory provides updates on the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) for Food and Beverage (F&B) Establishments.
**Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs**

3.  Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) are no longer required, including for dining in at F&B establishments such as hawker centres and coffee shops.

-   2.1. This applies to events held in F&B establishments with > 500 participants at any one time.

**Other Safe Management Measures**

6.  In addition to the above, F&B establishments must adhere to prevailing SMMs in the [Annex](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Oct/ja-78.pdf).
7.  Firm action will be taken against any breaches under relevant laws. For instance, under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.
