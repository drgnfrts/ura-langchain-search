CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

  

Who Should Know:  
Architects, landscape architects, building owners and developers

  

Effective Date:  
With effect from 3 June 2022

  

1.  In 2017, as part of URA's efforts to improve the quality of public spaces in private developments, URA launched the Design Guidelines for Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) which outline the minimum design standards to be complied with, for developments which are required to provide a public space and/or seeking Gross Floor Area exemption for a first-storey covered public space (Circular No.: URA/PB/2017/02-PCUDG dated 24 January 2017). The guidelines ensure that new POPS are designed as usable and comfortable spaces with sufficient provision of seating and shade.  
      
    
2.  With the increased importance of public spaces, URA has reviewed the Design Guidelines for POPS. Bonus GFA for Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORA), currently applicable to only Orchard Road and Singapore River planning areas, will be extended to all POPS, to contribute to a more vibrant Singapore streetscape. ORA within POPS can be considered over and above the maximum intensity stipulated in the Master Plan for the site1.  
      
    
3.  For developments which have not maximised their development potential, ORA within POPS can be considered provided that the prevailing planning and urban design guidelines for the development and the POPS are complied with. The key revisions to the guidelines regarding ORA within POPS are included in section 5 of Annex 1.
    

Please refer to2:

**[Annex 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Jun/dc22-07_Annex-1.pdf)** for the revised detailed guidelines for POPS and the guidelines for ORA within POPS;

**[Annex 2](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2022/Jun/dc22-07_Annex-2.pdf)** for the revised submission requirements for POPS.

****Implementation****

4.  The revised guidelines for POPS will take effect from 3 Jun 2022 for all new proposals received on or after the effective date. All proposals are to be submitted to our Development Control Group and each proposal will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and on the merits of the individual proposals.

5.  The bonus GFA incentive scheme will remain valid for five years. URA will review the effectiveness and relevance of the scheme at the end of this five-year period, and reserve the right to vary or change the specific requirements and extent of incentives in this scheme during this five-year period.
