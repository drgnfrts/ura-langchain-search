CIRCULAR TO PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

Who Should Know:  
Developers, architects, and engineers

Effective Date:  
With immediate effect

1.  SCDF and BCA have jointly reviewed the "Technical Requirements for Storey Shelters 2015", and issued permissible variations, clarifications and additions vide Circular [CD/FSSD/12/02/03/01](https://www.corenet.gov.sg/media/2268628/circular-permissible-variations_clarifications_insertions-to-technical-requirements-for-storey-shelters-tr-ss-2015.PDF). The revised guidelines will accord more flexibility to the treatment of voids and service risers that abut shelter walls or are located within the storey shelter setback. Generally, only the roof and the level below the roof of the void and service riser that abut shelter walls will have to be slabbed over by reinforced concrete (RC).
2.  This circular seeks to clarify the GFA treatment for covered RC slabs in all voids and service risers.  


**GFA Treatment for Covered RC Slabs**

3.  Covered RC slabs proposed in voids and service risers will be computed as GFA. They do not qualify as mechanical and electrical (M&E) spaces for GFA exemption, even if the space has a low headroom (see **[Annex A](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2019/Aug/dc19-14/dc19-14---Annex-A.pdf)**). This is similar in treatment to other covered floor slabs being computed as GFA, regardless of whether they are accessible spaces.

4.  Metal grating/load-bearing mesh incorporated into service risers intended solely for maintenance access are not computed as GFA, provided that their width is 1m or less.  


**Implementation**

5.  The GFA treatment will apply with immediate effect to all new applications submitted on or after 19 August 2019. Only formal development applications (excluding Outline Applications) submitted before the effective date of 19 August 2019, which have already been granted Provisional Permission, will not be subject to the revised guidelines. \[1\]
