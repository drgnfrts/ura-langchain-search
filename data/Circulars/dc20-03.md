Effective Date:  
With effect from 01 Jun 2020

  

1.  URA has revised the Change of Use Lodgment Scheme to allow more shophouses and uses to qualify for the scheme.  
      
    **Existing Change of Use Lodgment Scheme**
    
2.  Currently, selected uses within the 1st storey of a list of pre-identified shophouses can be granted instant approval upon a lodgment application under the existing Change of Use Lodgment Scheme.  
      
    **Revised Scheme to allow lodgment for more shophouses and uses**
    
3.  Beyond the list of pre-identified shophouses, the Change of Use Lodgment Scheme will be extended to 1st storey premises approved for commercial use within all shophouses on sites zoned Commercial, Commercial & Residential or White in the Master Plan. URA has also included more uses that could qualify for lodgment.  
      
    
4.  The revision is part of continual efforts to improve the planning application process, and to facilitate more efficient change of use for business operators. URA expects the revised scheme to benefit more business owners and operators within shophouses. See [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Circulars/2020/Jun/dc20-03---Appendix-1.pdf) for the detailed set of criteria under the revised scheme. Business owners and operators can also visit "Allowable Use for Shophouses" tab on [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) to find out if their change of use proposal is eligible for lodgment and make an instant lodgment application.
