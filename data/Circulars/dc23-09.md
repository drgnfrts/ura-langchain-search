**REVISED CONSERVATION GUIDELINES**  
  
1. This circular is to inform the industry of the:

   - a) Revised conservation guidelines which are available [online](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Conservation-Guidelines).   
   - b) Completion of the last 3 volumes of the Conservation Technical Handbooks, in addition to the 5 already available.   
   - c) Latest Do-It-Right guide for Heritage Interpretation.   
  
**A. Revised Conservation Guidelines**

2. URA has carried out its latest review of the conservation and envelope control guidelines in consultation with practicing architects and engineers, contractors, conservation specialists and owners. The revised guidelines aim to enhance the character of conservation areas while giving due consideration to functional and technical requirements. Identified historic extensions which reflect the evolution of the streetscape and contribute to the identity of conservation areas will be recognized. The design of infill sites, as well as new interventions at key and prominent junctions will be guided more closely so that the historic character is not affected. In addition, to promote sustainability efforts, greater flexibility can be considered for addition of solar panels.

3. More details on the key revisions to the conservation guidelines are provided in [Appendix 1](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Circulars/dc23-09-Appendix-1.pdf).   
  
4. The revised guidelines are now available [online.](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Conservation-Guidelines)

**B. Conservation Technical Handbooks**
  
5. The eight-volume Conservation Technical Handbooks series was produced in collaboration with the local chapter of the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS SG).     
    
6. They cover different aspects of technical restoration, architectural elements and material usage for heritage buildings. The series contains best practices and technical expertise on restoration works, and detailed information on locally used materials, construction methods and restoration techniques. Through quality technical restoration and maintenance, our heritage buildings can be better sustained into the future.

7. The series is available for free download [online](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Best-Practices). 

**C. Do-It-Right Guide: Heritage Interpretation**
  
8. URA has a series of "Do-It-Right Guides" to provide guidance on common issues faced by building owners, tenants and Qualified Persons. They are available [online](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Best-Practices) for free download and include:  
    - Your Shophouse: Do-It-Right  
    - Signages: Do-It-Right  
    - Tiong Bahru: Do-It-Right

9. The latest Do-It-Right guide on Heritage Interpretation features selected projects which showcase ways to present the historical, architectural, cultural and social meanings and heritage values of buildings and sites. These include site installations, design intervention, education, publications, multimedia platforms and other outreach initiatives and programmes.

10. Heritage interpretation is as important as technical achievements in conservation projects. They create long-term value for the community. As such, the Architectural Heritage Awards (AHA) criteria has been revised since 2021 ([Circular No: URA/PB/2021/03-CUDG](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc21-03)), to include this aspect as part of the assessment. This Do-It-Right guide on Heritage Interpretation will be a useful reference.

11. I would appreciate it if you could convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation.
