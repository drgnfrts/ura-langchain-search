1.  The Master Plan 2019 is officially gazetted on 27 November 2019. The Master Plan is the statutory land use plan that guides the physical development of Singapore over the next 10 to 15 years. As part of Master Plan 2019, the former Railway Station Staff Quarters and the former Bukit Timah Fire Station have also been gazetted for conservation.
  
3.  The gazette concludes the review of the Draft Master Plan 2019 which took place over the last two years. During the review period, URA engaged stakeholders, including residents, interest groups, professional institutes, grassroots leaders and Advisors, on our plans. The constructive feedback gathered from these stakeholders have helped to shape our draft plans and contributed to the Draft Master Plan 2019.
  
5.  The Draft Master Plan 2019 was exhibited at the URA Centre Atrium from late March till June 2019, and attracted over 25,000 stakeholders and interested members of public. To reach out to more residents, regional plans were also exhibited at Waterway Point, Westgate, Junction 8, Our Tampines Hub and Causeway Point between late July and early August.
