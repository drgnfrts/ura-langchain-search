LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the development uses.

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and an upper bound – see figure below. The range varies according to location zones and land uses.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
LTA may consider conversion of car parks up to the lower bound as stipulated in the RPPS. Interested building owners are to arrange for a pre-application consultation with LTA before submitting a development application to URA.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The conversion of surplus car park may be allowed subject to compliance with ALL of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
    The proposed uses shall be in line with the Master Plan zoning for the site and the planning intention for the surrounding area. The detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
    The existing infrastructure and traffic network shall be able to support the increase in GFA and uses, and take into consideration proposed measures to mitigate traffic generation.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
    The resultant car parking provision shall be able to support the additional GFA and proposed uses.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
    Additional GFA arising from the conversion may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. The additional GFA arising from the conversion of surplus car parking, detailed uses and any changes to the building form and design shall be subject to evaluation by URA and the relevant agencies.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
    Requests for conversion of surplus car parks may not be supported for sites where there are specific conditions imposed in planning approval or the government land sale that restrict the conversion of the surplus car parking spaces, or sites located within or adjacent to Conservation Areas where additional car parking spaces are needed to support the uses within the conserved buildings.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additional GFA gained via the conversion of surplus car parking spaces shall not be taken into consideration in determining the maximum permissible intensity that may be allowed for the re-development of the site.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Where surplus car parking spaces were allowed by LTA through a waiver application to exceed the upper bound of the Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS) after 1 Feb 2019, the development will not be allowed to convert any of the surplus car parking spaces to other uses.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;"><sup>3</sup> With the RPPS, surplus car parking lots in existing developments may arise if the upper bound for the development type is revised downward and/or if developments choose to reduce car parking provision to the lower bound set out by the RPPS.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion of Surplus Car Parking Spaces within Central Area</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In line with the planning intention to encourage conversion of office developments to Residential, Hotel and other mixed uses within the CBD, only applications for conversion of existing surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses (see examples in the table below) will be considered in selected areas where <a></a><a href="/Corporate/Data/circulars/2019/Mar/dc19-04" target="_blank">CBD Incentive Scheme&nbsp;</a>applies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For the rest of the Central Area, conversion of surplus car parking spaces to non-office uses is also highly encouraged, in line with the planning intention to inject more live-in population in the city.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>This guide provides information, best practices and recommendations regarding the design and operation of the loading bays within commercial buildings, to achieve the following objectives:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span>Efficient loading/unloading turnaround time</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span> Improve traffic safety and goods flow</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Adapt to changing delivery trends</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In cases where it is difficult to adhere to the good practice for the design and operation of the loading bays, we encourage buildings owners to explore other means to achieve the same design and operation principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Best Practice Guide supplements the technical agencies’ prevailing Code of Practices, requirements or design standards, which should take precedence.</span></p>
