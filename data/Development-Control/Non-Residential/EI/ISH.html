<p style="text-align: center;"><em>School Field and Indoor Sports Hall&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Primary/Secondary Schools shall share their school fields and ISHs with the wider community. Separate and independent pedestrian access to the school field and ISHs shall be provided in addition to the normal vehicular and pedestrian access for the school.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For fields, there shall be a clear demarcation from the main school buildings so that the field could be fenced up and opened to the community outside of school hours. The field and the ISH shall both be maintained by the school.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the design and location of fields and ISHs, the surrounding environment shall be taken into consideration  to minimize dis-amenity arising from activities.
