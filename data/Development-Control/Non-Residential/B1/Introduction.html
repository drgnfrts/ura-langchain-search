    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses, telecommunication and utility buildings. Depending on the nature of their activities, clean and light industries are allowed in Business 1 (B1) zone. General and special industries are to be located in Business 2 (B2) zone.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 50m nuisance buffer from a B1 zone to the surrounding area. Industrial activities that require a nuisance buffer greater than 50m to the surrounding area may not be located in B1 zone. The allowable types of industry or use within industrial developments, based on NEAâ€™s nuisance buffer requirements, are listed <a href="https://e-services.nea.gov.sg/ias/PublicApplicant/Homepage.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.
