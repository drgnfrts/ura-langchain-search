    <h3>Racking Systems for Storage Purposes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Racking systems are excluded from GFA if they are standalone modular racking systems that do not form an integral component of the building (e.g. not of reinforced concrete construction), and are used for storage purposes<sup>1</sup> in industrial developments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please be reminded to seek the necessary clearances from other relevant agencies for the proposed racking system, such as BCA for structural safety and SCDF for fire safety.</span></p>
