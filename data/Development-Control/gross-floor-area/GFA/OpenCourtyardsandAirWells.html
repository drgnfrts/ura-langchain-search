    <h3>Open Courtyards and Air Wells</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Open courtyards and air wells are recognised as existing GFA only for developments that existed before or in 1960. For post-1960 developments, the covering up of such areas are included as GFA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>From 2013 onwards, courtyards and air wells located within strata areas are to be included as GFA whether they are open or covered, whereas open courtyards and air wells located in the common areas are excluded from GFA.<br>
