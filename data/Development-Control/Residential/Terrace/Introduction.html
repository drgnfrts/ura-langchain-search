<p style="text-align: justify;">
A terrace house is a dwelling house with its own land title<sup>1</sup> that forms part of a row of at least 3 dwelling houses abutting the common boundary party walls. Terrace houses can be built in designated mixed landed housing areas, if the development site area meets the minimum plot size and width requirements. At the individual plot level, a terrace house shall adhere to the applicable storey height and envelope control guidelines and building setback requirements. The permissible Gross Floor Area (GFA) for such landed housing is resultant of the allowable building height and permissible building envelope under the envelope control guidelines.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are 2 types of terrace house typology - Terrace Type I and Terrace Type II. These are differentiated by their setback requirements.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For Terrace Type I houses, the setback from the road is based on standard road buffer requirements.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For Terrace Type II houses, the required setback from the road is standardised as 2m and 1m for building wall and roof eaves respectively. Terrace II houses shall also be sited within their own enclave (refer to <a></a><a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Terrace/Locational-Criteria" target="_blank">Locational Criteria</a> for more information).
</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>1</sup> Terrace houses may also be strata-titled when approved as strata terrace houses – See <a></a><a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing">Strata Landed Housing</a> for guidelines and requirements.</p>
