<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Flats and condominiums are non-landed residential developments approved for dwelling purpose. Each residential unit shall have a satisfactory layout for residential purpose comprising bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, a kitchen and toilets.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Flats and condominiums are allowed in areas zoned Residential, Commercial &amp; Residential, Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey, White, and Residential/Institution (in the Geylang Planning Area) in the Master Plan. They are not allowed in areas designated only for landed housing developments, except for existing flats and condominiums previously approved in such areas. The residential component within a mixed use development will be approved as flats and will not be accorded condominium status.</p>
