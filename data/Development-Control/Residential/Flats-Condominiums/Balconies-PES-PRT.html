The GFA of balconies in flats and condominium developments may be computed over and above the Master Plan (MP) allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 7% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable. When submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 7% of the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height or use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master Plan, Building Height Plan or Special and Detailed Control Plan. For instance, a flats development within a designated landed housing area shall not qualify for the bonus balcony GFA.
