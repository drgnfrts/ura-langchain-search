Racking systems are excluded from GFA if they are standalone modular racking systems that do not form an integral component of the building (e.g. not of reinforced concrete construction), and are used for storage purposes1 in industrial developments.

Please be reminded to seek the necessary clearances from other relevant agencies for the proposed racking system, such as BCA for structural safety and SCDF for fire safety.



1The storage use should be related to the main industrial use of the unit/development, and human access to the racking systems should be for the storage and retrieval of goods only.
