Air-Conditioner Ledges

Air-conditioner (A/C) ledges that are included as strata area will be computed as GFA.

Non-strata AC ledges not exceeding 2.0m in width (as measured perpendicularly from the external wall) are not computed as GFA. For non-strata AC ledges exceeding 2.0m in width, the area to be excluded from GFA is only up to 2.0m in width.
