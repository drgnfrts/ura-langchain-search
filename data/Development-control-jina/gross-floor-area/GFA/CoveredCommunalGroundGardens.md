Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at the 1st storey. Such gardens should flow seamlessly between the covered and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

-   Secondary C2G2
-   Predominant C2G2

All areas of the C2G2 shall be accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development. The communal ground garden shall not be enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future. Covered ornamental pond/ reflective pool that forms part of the communal landscape areas may also be considered as part of the C2G2.

A landscape plan showing the proposed landscaping scheme and areas within/beyond the 45-degree line shall be submitted as part of the development application for assessment of the proposed C2G2.

Secondary C2G2

Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be excluded from GFA up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead projection. The communal landscaped areas excluded from GFA within the 45-degree line must be unenclosed, accessible and contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of vegetation.

Predominant C2G2

For Predominant C2G2, the additional covered areas beyond the 45-degree line may be considered for exclusion from GFA if the spaces provide substantial ground greenery with good spatial quality.

For on-ground greenery to qualify as a Predominant C2G2, it shall comply with the following requirements:

-   The covered garden area should occupy at least 50% of the 1st storey building footprint;
  
-   Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly landscaped while the remaining 40% shall be set aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces and unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds and covered ornamental pools.
  
-   Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping;
  
-   Both the covered and uncovered landscaped area shall include suitable varieties of plants which are planted in permanent and preferably sunken planting beds to enhance the spatial and visual quality of the space.
  
-   As the communal landscaped areas are intended to serve the public and/or building users, they shall be easily accessible to the public and/or building users during normal opening hours for the development1. They should also not be tucked away in dark/obscure corners which will not be conducive for landscaping as well as public use.

While uses like ORA may be proposed within the C2G2, the ORA areas would be included as GFA. Appropriate design interventions shall be adopted to minimise easy conversion of areas excluded as GFA to usable commercial spaces subsequently. The C2G2 should not be easily enclosed and converted to any other uses in the future.

1 For example, the communal landscaped areas in a shopping mall shall be open and accessible to the public during the mall's normal operating hours.

Columns within 45-Degree Line

For scenarios where covered areas within the 45-degree line are excluded from GFA (e.g. Communal Covered Ground Garden and Sky Terraces), the area shadowed by columns are excluded from GFA.

If the column is excessively large (akin to a wall), the shadowed area shall be included as GFA. The 45-degree line for GFA exemption is not applicable in such instance.
