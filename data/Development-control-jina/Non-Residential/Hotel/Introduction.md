Hotel developments, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are primarily public accommodation facilities for commercial purpose. While Hotels are predominantly used as accommodation, other limited supporting commercial uses such as shops, restaurants and bars may be allowed.

Only the commercial use component within a hotel development may be strata subdivided.

Backpackers' hostels, regulated under the Hotels Licensing Act, are also public accommodation facilities for commercial purpose. They are open concept dormitories for boarding and lodging purposes, with a minimum of 6 beds per room. Refer [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for-Business/Assessment-Criteria) for the guidelines and requirements for conversion of an existing property to a backpackers' hostel which may allowed on a temporary planning permission.
