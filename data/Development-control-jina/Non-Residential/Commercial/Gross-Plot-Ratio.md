The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a commercial development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). The MP plot ratio is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of site limitations like shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.

If the GPR is not specified in the Master Plan, the development potential would be determined taking into consideration the location, site context, traffic and impact of the commercial development on the surroundings.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage Reserve1 (DR) and/or Road Reserve2 (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

1 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain

2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
