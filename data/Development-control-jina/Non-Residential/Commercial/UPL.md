To improve the overall connectivity network, building owners/developers are encouraged to construct direct subterranean connections from nearby developments to existing and future RTS stations. The UPL shall form part of the public circulation network, designed to be barrier-free, and be directly accessible from common public areas during the operating hours of the RTS.

Use

Activity-generating uses such as shops and eating establishments shall be incorporated along one or both sides of the UPL linking to the RTS station.

Opening Hours

The UPL shall be open during operating hours of the RTS station/normal business operation hours for public use. Signage indicating opening hours shall be provided at the entrances of the link.

Size

-   The UPL shall provide a clear walkway width of:
    *   6 â€“ 7m for UPLs without shops or with single-loaded uses

-   The UPL shall provide a clear minimum ceiling height of 4m.
-   The activity-generating uses may be allowed a maximum total depth of 14m.

GFA

-   Given its function as a public thoroughfare, the walkway of the UPL may be exempted from GFA computation subject to the compliance with the criteria above. For walkways more than 7m wide, GFA exemption may be considered depending on the merits of the proposal.
-   The activity-generating use shall be computed as GFA and may be computed over and above the allowable GPR as stipulated in the prevailing Master Plan or permissible GFA for the development.
-   The GFA for this additional commercial space is not transferrable and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment.
-   Additional GFA from activity-generating use may be subject to SLA levying Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

Submission Plans

-   Properly annotated plans and sections showing the proposed UPL in relation to the adjoining developments and nearby RTS station shall be submitted for evaluation by URA.
-   Since a UPL will occupy State land, the developer/owner shall obtain SLA's endorsement for the submitted plans.
