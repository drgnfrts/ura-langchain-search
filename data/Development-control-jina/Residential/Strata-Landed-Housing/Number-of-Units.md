Maximum number of strata landed units

![Image 1: Allowable intensity for a strata landed development](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SL02_Intensity.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25)



The cap on the number of allowable units in strata landed housing developments shall be based on the typical footprint of the conventional landed housing form used and the development's location.

The formulae to compute the maximum number of allowable units in the various types of strata landed housing developments are shown in the table below.

The number of units shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Where necessary, URA may impose stricter controls on the allowable number of strata landed units for developments in localised areas of concern (eg severe infrastructural capacity issues), in consultation with other agencies.

Gross Floor Area (Individual Units)

The gross floor area for each individual strata landed housing unit is the resultant of the building form and envelope.

Gross Floor Area (Overall Development)

For developments comprising strata landed housing only, the overall gross floor area is the resultant of the number of strata landed units allowed. Refer to section above.

For residential developments with a mix of strata landed housing and flat units, the overall Gross Floor Area shall be controlled by the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio for the site.

Commercial Quantum

Commercial uses are not allowed within strata landed housing developments.
