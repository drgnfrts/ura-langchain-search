Plot Width for Irregular Plots

For plots of irregular shape within existing landed housing estates, slight deficiency in the required plot width for semi-detached housing may be considered provided:

-   The average width of the site remains at least 8m so as to allow for a meaningful building footprint and internal layout;
-   The absolute minimum plot width at its narrowest shall be 4m;
-   The plot shall fully comply with the minimum plot size control and all other development control guidelines eg setback, road buffer, etc.

The deficiency in plot width, if allowed, shall be restricted to one plot per development and shall be a residual plot (ie all other plots within the same development shall comply fully with the minimum plot width).
