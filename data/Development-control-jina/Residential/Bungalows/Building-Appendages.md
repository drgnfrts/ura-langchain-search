-   All structures shall generally be confined within the envelope. The car porch and patio/terrace area are subject to the setback guidelines shown in the [Building Setbacks](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Bungalows/Setbacks-from-boundaries) section.
-   Minor building appendages that do not increase the building bulk may be allowed to encroach slightly into the setback areas, as shown in the table below. While the building appendages may be within the permissible building envelope, such features may require further evaluation depending on the site context, to ensure that they do not substantially add to building bulk.
-   Allowable protrusion into the setbacks for other building appendages not covered in the matrix shall be assessed based on the merits of the proposal.

Car Porch

-   The height of the car porch shall not exceed 4.5m.
-   The car porch roof may be used as a balcony or garden, but it shall remain open-to-sky and unenclosed area. Only the following may be allowed on the car porch roof:  
      
    1.  A maximum 1m high parapet wall around the perimeter of the car porch roof, constructed of visually porous material (eg tempered glass and railing);
    2.  A maximum 1m wide sun shading canopy, cantilevered from the building wall to provide weather protection for the opening to the car porch roof;
    3.  Planters for landscaping.

Minor Building Appendages

**Maximum allowable protrusion of minor building appendages into road buffer and common boundary setbacks**

**_Note_**_:_

-   If the plot abuts a GCBA plot, the minimum setback is 3m.
-   These standards are based on Cat 3-5 roads. Setback requirement for other building features not covered under the table shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal.
