<h3>Structural Protrusion</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building features which are excluded from GFA can be allowed to extend from the building wall line to serve different needs. These features are typically short appendages and not extensive overhangs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In situations where one building feature is added on to another, the width of projection of these structures are measured from the building wall line. If the proposed feature as measured from the wall line exceeds the dimension prescribed for exclusion from GFA, it is to be included as GFA as illustrated below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The width of the projection of each item that is excluded from GFA measured from the external building wall line cannot exceed the maximum allowable width. Otherwise, the entire structure would be included as GFA.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 160px;"><em>Example 1 - Structural Protrusion from Building Wall Line (Section)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reinforced Concrete (RC) ledges and non-strata AC ledges not exceeding 2.0m in width, as measured perpendicularly from the external wall are excluded from GFA. If the combined width of the structural protrusion as shown in Example 1 exceeds 2.0m in width, the entire structure would be included as GFA.</p>
