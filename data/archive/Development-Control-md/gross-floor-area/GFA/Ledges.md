Air-Conditioner Ledges

Air-conditioner (A/C) ledges that are included as strata area will be
computed as GFA.

Non-strata AC ledges not exceeding 2.0m in width (as measured
perpendicularly from the external wall) are not computed as GFA. For
non-strata AC ledges exceeding 2.0m in width, the area to be excluded
from GFA is only up to 2.0m in width.
