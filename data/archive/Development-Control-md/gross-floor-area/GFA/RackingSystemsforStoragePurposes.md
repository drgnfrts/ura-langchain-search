### Racking Systems for Storage Purposes

<span style="color: #000000;">Racking systems are excluded from GFA if
they are standalone modular racking systems that do not form an integral
component of the building (e.g. not of reinforced concrete
construction), and are used for storage purposes<sup>1</sup> in
industrial developments.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Please be reminded to seek the necessary
clearances from other relevant agencies for the proposed racking system,
such as BCA for structural safety and SCDF for fire safety.</span>

storage use should be related to the main industrial use of the
unit/development, and human access to the racking systems should be for
the storage and retrieval of goods only. </span>
