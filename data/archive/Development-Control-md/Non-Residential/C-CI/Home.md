### Home for the Aged or Home for the Disabled

Purpose-built Homes for the Aged or Homes for the Disabled are meant to
provide residential accommodation with board and care for the elderly
and the disabled respectively.

Homes for the Aged are licensed by the Ministry of Social and Family
Development. 

Free-standing or independent Homes for the Aged/Disabled are typically
zoned “Civic and Community Institution” or “Residential/Institution” in
the Master Plan. They may be allowed at the void decks of public housing
blocks as facilities ancillary to the residential use.

Conversion of properties to Homes for the Aged or Disabled and the
actual allowable building form (ie stand-alone or party-wall) will be
assessed taking into account the site location, site context and
detailed development guidelines in the prevailing street block plans, if
any.

Gross Plot Ratio & Storey Height

The allowable gross plot ratio and number of storeys for Homes for the
Aged or Disabled developments shall take into account the character of
the surrounding area. The actual number of storeys allowed may vary,
depending on the site topography and the context of the surrounding
area.

Homes for the Aged or Disabled of 3-storey and above shall be provided
with lifts.

For redevelopment of an existing approved Home for the Aged or Disabled
to carry out major extensions to it, the proposed increase in GPR or GFA
is subject to planning consideration taking into account the location of
the home, context of the surrounding area and requirements of other
government agencies. Planning approval from URA shall be obtained first
before commencement of works.
