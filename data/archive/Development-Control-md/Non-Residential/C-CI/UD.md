### Urban Design Requirements

Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) are to preserve and enhance the urban
character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure that
developments integrate well with their surrounding urban environment.

Developments in the Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong
Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District and Woodlands
Central), may be guided by specific
<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design"
target="_blank">urban design requirements</a>, where the planning
intention is to introduce activity generating uses. These urban design
requirements shall take precedence over the standard development control
parameters.

Refer to <a

Urban Design Guidelines Plan and designated AGU areas.

Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

<span style="color: black;">AGUs help to activate and enliven streets;
contributing to its vibrancy, providing key basic amenities, and
attracting visitor-ship to the precincts. The following situations may
require AGUs:</span>

1.  <span style="color: black;">Urban Design Areas shown in the Special
    and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design
    Plan;</span>
2.  <span style="color: black;">Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where
    AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
    </span>
3.  <span style="color: black;">Sites that undergo redevelopment or
    major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning
    conditions issued for these works; </span>
4.  <span style="color: black;">Other areas as directed and specified by
    the Competent Authority.</span>

<span style="color: black;">AGUs may be required to be provided in the
following typical locations:</span>

1.  <span style="color: black;">1<sup>st</sup> storey of developments
    fronting key streets, pedestrian malls, through block links, and
    public spaces;</span>
2.  <span style="color: black;">Alongside underground pedestrian links
    (UPLs) at the basement levels of the developments; </span>
3.  <span style="color: black;">Alongside elevated pedestrian links
    (EPLs) at the 2<sup>nd</sup> storey of the developments.</span>

<span style="color: black;">The proposed AGUs in the above locations are
to be assessed contextually, taking into account the planning intention
for the area and potential amenity problems that will impact on the
surrounding developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not
directly contribute to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause
amenity problems to neighbours.</span>
