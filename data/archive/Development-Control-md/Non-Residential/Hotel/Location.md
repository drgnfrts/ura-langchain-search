### Location

Hotel developments are allowed on land zoned "Hotel" in the Master Plan
although some existing hotels approved some time ago may be occupying
land currently not zoned Hotel.

Hotel developments located on land zoned Hotel or land zoned for other
uses with a requirement to provide a minimum hotel quantum in the Master
Plan are not allowed to be converted to other uses.

Hotel developments and backpackers' hostels may be considered on land
that are not zoned for Hotel use in the Master Plan. Such cases shall be
evaluated individually, taking into account the planning intention and
compatibility with the surrounding land uses.

Areas where new hotel developments and backpackers' hostels are not
allowed can be found <a
