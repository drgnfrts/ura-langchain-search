### Provision of Open and Covered Public Walkways

All hotel developments shall provide covered walkways along the
periphery of the building facing roads and pedestrian routes.

Covered walkways for hotel developments in the Central Area may be
guided by urban design requirements. These urban design requirements
shall take precedence over the standard development control parameters.

The specific urban design requirements for each planning area within the
Central Area can be found on our [Urban
Design](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design)
Website.

Height of Covered Walkways

The soffit height of covered walkways is 3.6m.

Where higher ceiling height is desired, glass or other cladding may be
provided at the edge of the covered walkway to achieve the 3.6m height.

A higher soffit height may be allowed in independent developments
provided the walkway width is increased correspondingly to maintain the
45-degree angle, at main entrances to facilitate articulation, and on
urban design grounds.

<a href="#Width" class="collapsible collapsed"

Width of Covered Walkways

The minimum width for covered walkways varies depending on the location
of the site and proximity to transport nodes. These are subject to urban
design guidelines for selected locations with higher footfall eg Central
Area, Regional Centres and Key Growth Areas. For walkways wider than the
minimum requirement, GFA exemption may be considered depending on merits
of the proposal.

Location & Design of Covered Walkways

Covered walkways shall be provided at the periphery of the buildings
next to or facing public roads.

The walkways shall be continuous, providing connections into the
interior of the building, open space or open walkway. All ramps leading
into the interior of the building shall begin outside the covered
walkway.

Covered walkways shall be seamlessly connected to adjoining
developments. Covered linkways shall be provided between non-party
wall<sup>1</sup> developments.

All level differences within the covered walkways shall be mitigated
with ramps and not steps. For covered linkways between developments,
steps are only allowed for steep gradient where ramping is not possible.
All ramps leading into the interior of the building shall begin outside
the covered walkway.

Covered walkways shall be kept free from all obstructions. All building
services and services which may cause obstruction when maintenance works
are being carried out shall be located within the building.
