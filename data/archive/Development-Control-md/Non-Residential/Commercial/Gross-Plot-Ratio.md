### Gross Plot Ratio

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a commercial development is
guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP). The MP plot ratio
is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of site
limitations like shape of the plot, site topography or ground
conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements
of other authorities that may affect the site.

If the GPR is not specified in the Master Plan, the development
potential would be determined taking into consideration the location,
site context, traffic and impact of the commercial development on the
surroundings.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage
Reserve<sup>1</sup> (DR) and/or Road Reserve<sup>2</sup> (RR) to be
vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the
gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

<sup>1</sup> **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes
of building or widening a public drain

<sup>2</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
