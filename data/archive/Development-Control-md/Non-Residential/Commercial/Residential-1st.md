<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Commercial/RC03_Location_commercial_uses_B.jpeg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

*Allowable Location of Commercial Uses - Type B*

Commercial uses at the basement and upper floors may be considered for
developments located within the Central Area or if the development is
within a mixed use area fronting major arterial routes outside the
Central Area. Proposals to transfer commercial uses to the other storeys
shall be evaluated depending on merits, taking into consideration the
location, site context, traffic, and impact on the surroundings.

If permitted, proposals to transfer commercial uses to the other storey
shall comply with the following guidelines:

-   Total commercial quantum shall not exceed the maximum commercial
    quantum allowed at the 1<sup>st</sup> storey;
-   There shall be commercial uses at the 1<sup>st</sup> storey fronting
    the street;
-   The commercial areas shall be contiguous;
-   There shall be a clear separation between the commercial and
    residential uses;
-   The commercial uses shall be kept within the minimum height of the
    building edge for the streetblock or 4-storeys, whichever is
    applicable; and
-   The commercial uses shall not create disamenity to the adjoining
    residential use

Use Quantum and Allowable Uses

The allowable commercial quantum is determined by the 1<sup>st</sup>
storey building footprint.

Commercial uses that are likely to cause disamenity to the residents are
not allowed. Examples of such commercial uses include night clubs and
karaoke bars.

*Setback Requirements for Residential with 1<sup>st</sup> Storey
Commercial Developments*

All buildings in “Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey”
developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common
boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road
reserve<sup>1</sup> line or boundary line to the external wall of the
buildings, excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or
drainage purpose.

All buildings in “Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey”
developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer, the
width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer
shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road
buffer.

The road buffer and common boundary setback requirements for
“Residential with Commercial at 1<sup>st</sup> Storey” developments are
determined by the building form and are detailed in the table below.
