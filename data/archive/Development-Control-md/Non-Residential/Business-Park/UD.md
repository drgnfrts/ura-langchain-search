### Urban Design Requirements

Guidelines on Urban Design (UD) intentions are to preserve and enhance
the urban character of the different planning areas. They help to ensure
that developments integrate well with their surrounding urban
environment.

Developments in the Central Area and Key Growth areas (such as Jurong
Gateway, Paya Lebar Central, Punggol Digital District and Woodlands
Central), may be guided by specific

design
requirements](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design),
where the planning intention is to introduce activity generating uses.
These urban design requirements shall take precedence over the standard
development control parameters.

designated AGU areas.

Activity Generating Uses (AGUs)

AGUs help to activate and enliven streets; contributing to its vibrancy,
providing key basic amenities, and attracting visitor-ship to the
precincts. The following situations may require AGUs:

1.  <span style="color: black;">Urban Design Areas shown in the Special
    and Detailed Control Plan (SDCP) Street Block and Urban Design
    Plan;</span>
2.  <span style="color: black;">Government Land Sale (GLS) sites where
    AGUs are required as part of the Technical Conditions of Tender;
    </span>
3.  <span style="color: black;">Sites that undergo redevelopment or
    major A&A works and where AGUs are required as part of the planning
    conditions issued for these works; </span>
4.  <span style="color: black;">Other areas as directed and specified by
    the Competent Authority.</span>

AGUs may be required to be provided in the following typical locations:

1.  1<sup>st</sup> storey of developments fronting key streets,
    pedestrian malls, through block links, and public spaces;
2.  Alongside underground pedestrian links (UPLs) at the basement levels
    of the developments;
3.  Alongside elevated pedestrian links (EPLs) at the 2<sup>nd</sup>
    storey of the developments.

The proposed AGUs in the above locations are to be assessed
contextually, taking into account the planning intention for the area
and potential amenity problems that will impact on the surrounding
developments. Uses not allowed are those that do not directly contribute
to street vibrancy and/or can potentially cause amenity problems to
neighbours.
