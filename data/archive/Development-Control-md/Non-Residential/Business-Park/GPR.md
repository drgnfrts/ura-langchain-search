### Gross Plot Ratio

The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a BP development is guided by the GPR
specified in the Master Plan (MP). The upper bound GPR may not always be
achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the
plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building
height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect
the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage
Reserve<sup>1</sup> (DR) and/or Road Reserve<sup>2</sup> (RR) to be
vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the
gross floor area (GFA) for a GPR – see figure below.

<sup>1</sup> **Drainage Reserve**: An area safeguarded for purposes of
building or widening a public drain.

<sup>2</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.
