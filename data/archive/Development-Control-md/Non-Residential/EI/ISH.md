<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/E01_School_Field.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

*School Field and Indoor Sports HallÂ *

Primary/Secondary Schools shall share their school fields and ISHs with
the wider community. Separate and independent pedestrian access to the
school field and ISHs shall be provided in addition to the normal
vehicular and pedestrian access for the school.

For fields, there shall be a clear demarcation from the main school
buildings so that the field could be fenced up and opened to the
community outside of school hours. The field and the ISH shall both be
maintained by the school.

In the design and location of fields and ISHs, the surrounding
environment shall be taken into consideration to minimize dis-amenity
arising from activities.
