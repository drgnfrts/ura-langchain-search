### Envelope Control Guidelines

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SL05_Building_Envelope.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

*Envelope Control Guidelines*

From 11 May 2015, landed housing is controlled by the envelope control
guidelines. The guidelines define an allowable building envelope for
each landed housing unit based on the landed housing type, setbacks and
storey height.

-   The building footprint of each strata landed unit shall have minimum
    ground contact of 50sqm;
-   Each unit shall not exceed the permissible building envelope for its
    landed housing type<sup>1</sup>;
-   The building envelope is illustrated in the figures below.

For existing strata landed housing approved under previous landed
housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply
with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control
guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building
envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase
the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on a case-by-case
basis.

<sup>1</sup> For more details on the allowable configurations for the
semi-detached and terrace landed housing types, refer to Semi-Detached
Housing and Terrace Housing sections respectively.

Building Height

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height for
each strata landed housing unit shall be based on the allowable number
of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below
show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height
and allowable building height in metres.

-   Strata landed housing shall not exceed the 2 or 3-storey height
    control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the designated
    landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is lower. This is
    to ensure that the height of the development is sympathetic to the
    existing neighbourhood character<sup>2</sup>.
-   The allowable building height is measured from the external platform
    level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the
    allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the
    two distinct platform
    levels.<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; color: #000000;"></span>
-   <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; color: #000000;">Lift
    overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to
    1m beyond the allowable building height.</span>

*3-storey Envelope Control landed housing*

<sup>2</sup> Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:

-   Absolute technical height constraints<sup>@</sup> (eg Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at
    <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)
-   Urban design height controls (available at
    <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)

<sup>@</sup> The absolute technical height (based on Singapore Height
Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any the
other height controls.

Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a
typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on
the front façade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the
permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate
it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated
two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated
three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each
floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential
living.

<a href="#Attics" class="collapsible collapsed"

Attics

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the
permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where
roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at
least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to
ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building
envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the
permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that
are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

Basements

Basements may be built up to the limits shown in the table below.

<sup>3</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

#### Basements in Low-lying Areas

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the
Minimum Platform Level (MPL)<sup>4</sup> shall be treated as a basement
storey and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

-   Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the
    MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings<sup>5</sup>.
-   Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines
    for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for the
    site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m above the
    external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing
levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall
be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the
MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the
main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be
allowed to be built up to the site lot boundary.

<sup>4</sup> **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum
1<sup>st</sup> storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is
determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

<sup>5</sup> If external openings are proposed, additional requirements
from PUB shall be complied with, as follows:

-   The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the
    adjacent road level; and
-   Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car
    porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be
    permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be
    located above the MPL.

#### Basements on Sloping Sites

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above
existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure below as
long as the allowable basement protrusion is kept within the permissible
Envelope Control building height.
