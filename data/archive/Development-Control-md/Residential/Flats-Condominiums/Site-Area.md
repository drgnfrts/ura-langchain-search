### Site Area

The minimum site area for a flats and condominium development is
1,000sqm and 4,000sqm respectively. Condominiums require larger site
area to ensure that there is sufficient space for more communal and
recreational facilities.

For proposals where terrace or semi-detached houses breakaway for
redevelopment into flats & condominiums, the remaining adjacent lots
shall be capable of redevelopment into flats & condominiums. The
remaining adjacent lots are known as left-behind lots, and shall fulfil
the minimum site area of 1,000sqm.

<span style="color: red;"><span style="color: #000000;">The minimum site
area refers to the net area of the site excluding the area of the land
required to be set aside for vesting to the State e.g. excluding
Drainage Reserve (DR) and/or Road Reserve (RR)</span>.</span>
