### Basements

A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be
partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey
height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than
1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.Â

The physical limit for which the basement may be built up to is shown in
the table below.

<sup>1</sup> **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the
State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the
line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only
if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building
regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary
    shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0m from the
    point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the earth
    around the basement wall can be cut to slope down to achieve the
    2.0m basement exposure with openings).
-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip
    shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.
-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the
    basement shall not be allowed.
-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the
    vertical openings is subject to the requirements of the other
    technical departments.
-   Horizontal openings to the basement may be allowed within the
    setback distance outside the green buffer and planting strip,
    subject to provision of effective screening to hide the view to the
    basement.
