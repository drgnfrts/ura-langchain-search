### Building Length

The chart below illustrates the acceptable building height and building
length of flats and condominium developments of at least 8 storeys. The
objective is to minimise the creation of wall-like developments which
would adversely affect the quality of our built environment. Each
residential block shall be guided by the height and length ratio shown
under the ‘Acceptable Zone’:

*Framework for Building Height and Building Length*

Where there are multiple building blocks, there shall be a minimum
spacing between each block to visually break the massing of the
development. The minimum spacing standard is shown in the table below:

<table width="100%">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">&gt;24</td>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">&gt; 90m</td>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">15m</td>
</tr>

</table>

  

-   If 2 or more blocks fall within different height bands, the height
    of the taller block shall be used to determine the minimum building
    spacing.
-   If 2 or more blocks are unable to meet the minimum building spacing,
    the blocks shall be treated as a single block.

The zones illustrated in the graph above are:

1.  Acceptable Zone  
      
    -   Flats and condominium developments complying with the height and
        length ratio in an Acceptable Zone are unlikely to have an
        adverse impact on the surrounding environment.

1.  Intervention Zone  
      
    -   Flats and condominium developments with the height and length
        ratio shown below may or may not pose severe impact on the
        surrounding environment, depending on the site context and the
        design measures adopted by the designers.

1.  Undesirable Zone  
      
    -   Flats and condominium developments with the height and length
        ratio shown below are considered to be too massive in scale, and
        may adversely impact the surrounding environment. Apart from
        impeding wind flow, such buildings will block off views of the
        surrounding development and result in a congested skyline. Such
        developments are not likely to be supported.

Flats and condominium developments within the Intervention Zone shall be
subject to detailed evaluation. For developments falling within the
Intervention Zone, the following 3 performance criteria \[refer to (a)
to (c) below\] shall be met. This may be achieved through the suggested
measures listed below, or other alternatives that the QP may propose:

1.  Whether the development enhances the streetscape  
      
    -   Blocks fronting roads shall be staggered at the foreground and
        background so that pockets of greenery are created along the
        street.

1.  Whether the surrounding developments can also view major green and
    blue public spaces  
      
    -   The placement and design of the blocks shall minimise blocking
        of views towards public assets such as waterbodies, parks, etc.
    -   The design of the blocks shall provide permeability in the form
        of sky terrace floors or fenceless boundaries so as to promote
        visual relief and wind movement.

1.  Whether effective mitigating measures have been adopted to break
    down building massing  
      
    -   Building heights may be varied.
    -   More interesting building ‘crowns’ may be proposed as opposed to
        flat roofs.
    -   Landmark blocks may be strategically located within the
        development to provide a focal point.
    -   The façade shall be well articulated with visually interesting
        patterns.
