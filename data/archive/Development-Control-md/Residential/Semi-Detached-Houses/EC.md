### Envelope Control Guidelines

<https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/SD04B_Envelope_Control_3D_Fins.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25>

*Envelope Control Guidelines*

From 11 May 2015, landed housing shall follow the envelope control
guidelines. The guidelines define an allowable building envelope based
on storey height and building setbacks. The development shall not exceed
the permissible building envelope as illustrated in figure above.

For existing landed housing approved under previous conventional landed
housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply
with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control
guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building
envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase
the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on the merits of
the proposal.

Building Height

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height is
based on the allowable number of storeys and the floor-to-floor
height in metres. The figures below show the building envelope and the
relationship between storey height and allowable building height in
metres.

-   Landed housing shall not exceed the 2-storey or 3-storey
    height control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the
    designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is
    lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is
    sympathetic to the existing character<sup>1</sup> of landed housing
    in the neighbourhood.
-   The allowable building height is measured from the external platform
    level. If there is an existing level difference within the site, the
    allowable building envelope height may be taken separately from the
    two distinct platform levels.
-   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; text-align: justify;">Lift
    overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered up to
    1m beyond the allowable building height.</span>

*3-storey Envelope Control landed housing*

<sup>1</sup> Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:

-   Absolute technical height constraints<sup>@</sup> (eg Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).
-   Conservation guidelines (available at
    <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)
-   Urban design height controls (available at
    <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB" target="_blank">URA
    SPACE</a>)

<sup>@</sup> The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height
Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the
other height controls.

Mezzanine Floors

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a
typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on
the front façade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the
permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate
it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated
two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated
three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each
floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential
living.

<a href="#Attics" class="collapsible collapsed"

Attics

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the
permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where
roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at
least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to
ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building
envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the
permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that
are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

#### Basements in Low-lying Areas

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the
minimum platform level (MPL)<sup>3</sup> shall be treated as a basement
storey and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

-   Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the
    MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings<sup>4</sup>.
-   Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines
    for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for the
    site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m above the
    external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing
levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall
be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the
MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the
main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be
built up to the site lot boundary.

*Basement guidelines for low-lying sites*

<sup>3</sup> **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum
1<sup>st</sup> storey level to be provided within the site. The MPL is
determined by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

<sup>4</sup> If external openings are proposed, additional requirements
from PUB shall be complied with, as follows:

-   The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the
    adjacent road level; and
-   Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car
    porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be
    permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be
    located above the MPL.

#### Basements on Sloping Sites

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above
existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure below as
long as the basement protrusion is kept within the permissible Envelope
Control building height.
