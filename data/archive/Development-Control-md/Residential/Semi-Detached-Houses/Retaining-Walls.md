Retaining Walls

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar
the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

-   Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be
    considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered
    and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are
    impractical.
-   Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate
    greenery effect, if fronting a road or street.

Boundary Walls

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m high.

The combined height of retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed
2.8m, of which a solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall
is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (eg
fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.

The height of the common boundary wall abutting the car porch/patio area
of semi-detached houses may be allowed up to the 1<sup>st</sup> storey
ceiling height.
