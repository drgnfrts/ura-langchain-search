Treatment of Existing Party Walls

The creation of a new blank party wall at the common boundary upon
redevelopment is generally not allowed.

For all redevelopments that involve detaching from an existing unit,
resulting in a bare and exposed party wall at the existing unit, the
person undertaking the redevelopment shall do the following:

-   Submit to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), an
    engineer’s certification of the structural stability of the
    remaining unit;
-   Plaster and paint the exposed blank wall and neaten any exposed roof
    of the remaining semi-detached house or terrace house as soon as the
    existing building(s) on the subject site is demolished; and
-   Allow the adjacent owner access to the site to maintain or repair
    the roof and the exposed blank wall of the remaining semi-detached
    house or terrace house. This is not required if part of the party
    wall within the subject site is retained.

After the adjoining unit is redeveloped, the remaining terrace unit may
remain as approved.
