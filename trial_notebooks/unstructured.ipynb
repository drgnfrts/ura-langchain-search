    "Hello! This notebook summarises the general efforts and methods used to try and parse the URA website data with the Unstructured library. Even though the effort was not successful, there are still some valuable insights to be gained - in particular, Unstructured works well for purely semantic-based text parsing rather than extraction based on HTML classes and ids, without the hallucinations of an LLM. This is also its weakness, as Unstructured is only interested in text content without references, which may be helpful in some cases but not this one.\n",
